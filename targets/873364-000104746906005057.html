<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>What is the purpose of the Annual Meeting?  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At our Annual Meeting, stockholders will act upon the matters outlined in the Notice of Annual Meeting, including the election of directors, the approval of an
amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and the approval of an amendment to the Company's 2004 Equity Compensation Plan. In addition, management will report on the performance of the
Company and respond to questions from stockholders. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Who is entitled to vote at the meeting?  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only stockholders of record at the close of business on March&nbsp;22, 2006, the record date for the meeting, are entitled to receive notice of and to
participate in the Annual Meeting. If you were a stockholder of record on that date, you will be entitled to vote all of the shares that you held on that date at the meeting, or any postponements or
adjournments of the meeting. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>What are the voting rights of the holders of Cephalon Common Stock?  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each outstanding share of Cephalon Common Stock will be entitled to one vote on each matter considered at the meeting. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Who can attend the meeting?  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to space availability, all stockholders as of the record date, or their duly appointed proxies, may attend the meeting. If you attend, please note that
you may be asked to present valid picture identification, such as a driver's license or passport. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please
also note that if you hold your shares in "street name" (that is, through a broker or other nominee), you will need to bring a copy of a brokerage statement reflecting your stock
ownership as of the record date and check in at the registration desk at the meeting. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>What constitutes a quorum?  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presence at the meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the aggregate voting power of the Common Stock outstanding on the record date

meeting to conduct its business. As of the record date, 60,289,997 shares of Common Stock, representing the same number of votes, were outstanding. Thus, the presence of the holders of Common
Stock representing at least 30,144,999 votes will be required to establish a quorum. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proxies
received but marked as abstentions and broker non-votes will be included in the calculation of the number of votes considered to be present at the meeting. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>How do I vote my shares?  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you complete and properly sign the accompanying proxy card and return it to the Company, it will be voted as you direct. If you are a registered stockholder
and attend the meeting, you may deliver your completed proxy card in person. "Street name" stockholders who wish to vote at the meeting will need to obtain a proxy form from the institution that holds
their shares. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Can I vote by telephone or electronically?  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are a registered stockholder (that is, if you hold your stock in certificate form), you may vote by telephone, or electronically through the Internet, by
following the instructions included with your proxy card. If your shares are held in "street name," please check your proxy card or contact your broker or nominee to determine whether you will be able
to vote by telephone or electronically. The deadline for voting by telephone or electronically is 11:59&nbsp;p.m., Eastern Standard Time, on May&nbsp;16, 2006. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Can I change my vote after I return my proxy card?  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Even after you have submitted your proxy, you may revoke or change your vote at any time before the proxy is exercised by filing with the Corporate Secretary
of the Company either a notice of revocation or a duly executed proxy bearing a later date (or by submitting a new proxy via the Internet or by telephone). If you attend the meeting in person, you may
request that the powers of the proxy holders be suspended with respect to your shares, although attendance at the meeting will not by itself revoke a previously granted proxy. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>How do I vote my 401(k) shares?  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you participate in the Cephalon,&nbsp;Inc. 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan (the "401(k) Plan"), you may give voting instructions as to the number of shares of
Common Stock equivalent to the interest in Cephalon Common Stock credited to your account as of the record date. You may provide voting instructions to The Vanguard Group by completing and returning
the proxy card accompanying this proxy statement. The trustee will vote your shares in accordance with your duly executed instructions received by May&nbsp;14, 2006. If you do not send instructions,
the trustee will vote the number of shares equal to the share equivalents credited to your account in the same proportion that it votes shares for which it did receive timely instructions. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>What are the Board's recommendations?  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless you give other instructions on your proxy card, the persons named as proxy holders on the proxy card will vote in accordance with the recommendations of
the Board. The Board's recommendation is set forth together with the description of each item in this proxy statement. In summary, the Board recommends a vote: </FONT></P>

counted for purposes of determining whether there is a quorum. As a result, the director nominees receiving the highest number of votes will be elected to the Board. </FONT></P>

entitled to vote on these matters is required to approve each matter. A properly executed proxy marked "Abstain" with respect to a matter will have the effect of a vote against such matter. Broker
non-votes are not considered shares entitled to vote and therefore will not be taken into account in determining the outcome of the vote. </FONT></P>

<HR NOSHADE>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>How does the Board select nominees for the Board?  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nominating Committee considers candidates for Board membership suggested by its members and other Board members, as well as management and stockholders. The
Nominating Committee also retains third-party executive search firms to identify candidates from time to time. A stockholder who wishes to recommend a prospective nominee for the Board should notify
the Company's Corporate Secretary or any member of the Nominating Committee in writing together with the information set forth in Section&nbsp;2.10 of the Company's bylaws. The Nominating Committee
also will consider whether to nominate any person nominated by a stockholder pursuant to the provisions of the Company's bylaws relating to stockholder nominations as described in "Additional
Information&#151;Advance Notice Procedures," below. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once
the Nominating Committee has identified a prospective nominee, the Nominating Committee makes an initial determination as to whether to conduct a full evaluation of the candidate.
This initial determination is based on whatever information is provided to the Nominating Committee with the recommendation of the prospective candidate, as well as the Nominating Committee's own
knowledge of the prospective candidate, which may be supplemented by inquiries to the person making the recommendation or others. The preliminary determination is based primarily on the need for
additional Board members to fill vacancies or expand the size of the Board and the likelihood that the prospective nominee can satisfy the evaluation factors described below. If the Nominating
Committee determines, in consultation with the Chairman of the Board and other Board members as appropriate, that additional consideration is warranted, it may request that a third-party search firm
gather additional information about the prospective nominee's background and experience and to report its findings to the Nominating Committee. The Nominating Committee then evaluates the prospective
nominee against the standards and qualifications set out in the Company's </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Corporate Governance Guidelines</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, including: </FONT></P>

<DL compact>

prospective nominee's standards of integrity, ethics, commitment and independence of thought and judgment;
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>the
prospective nominee's record of professional accomplishment in his/her chosen field;
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>the
prospective nominee's independence from a material personal, financial or professional interest in any present or potential competitor of the Company;

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Nominating Committee also considers such other relevant factors as it deems appropriate, including the current composition of the Board, the balance of management and independent
directors, the need for Audit Committee expertise and the evaluations of other prospective nominees. In connection with this evaluation, the Nominating Committee determines whether to interview the
prospective nominee, and if warranted, one or more members of the Nominating Committee, and others as appropriate, interview prospective nominees in person or by telephone. After completing this
evaluation and interview, the Nominating Committee makes a recommendation to the full Board as to the persons who should be nominated by the Board, and the Board determines the nominees after
considering the recommendation and report of the Nominating Committee. </FONT></P>

annual review of director independence. Under the Guidelines, at least a majority of the directors must satisfy the "independence" requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the NASDAQ

regulations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
December&nbsp;2005, the Nominating Committee undertook its review of director independence. During this review, the Nominating Committee considered whether any transactions and
relationships existed between each director or any member of his or her immediate family and the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates. The Nominating Committee also examined whether any
transactions or relationships were present between directors and members of the Company's senior management. The purpose of this review was to determine whether such relationships exist and, if so,
whether any such relationships or transactions were inconsistent with a determination that the director is independent. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
a result of this review, the Board affirmatively determined that all of the directors nominated for election at the Annual Meeting are independent, with the exception of
Dr.&nbsp;Baldino. Dr.&nbsp;Baldino is considered an inside director because of his employment as an executive officer of the Company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stockholders may communicate with the Company's Board by sending their communications to Cephalon,&nbsp;Inc. Board of Directors, c/o Corporate Secretary, 41
Moores Road, Frazer, PA 19355. The Nominating Committee of the Board has approved a process for handling letters received by the Company and addressed to independent members of the Board. Under that
process, the Corporate Secretary reviews all such correspondence and regularly forwards to the Board a summary of all such correspondence and copies of all correspondence that, in the opinion of the
Corporate Secretary, deals with the functions of the Board or its committees, or that he otherwise determines requires their attention. Directors may at any time review a log of all correspondence
received by the Company that is addressed to members of the Board and request copies of any such correspondence. Concerns relating to accounting, internal controls or auditing matters are immediately
brought to the attention of the Company's internal audit department and handled in accordance with procedures established by the Audit Committee with respect to such matters. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has a Code of Conduct that is applicable to all employees of the Company. The Company also has a Code of Ethics for Financial Officers covering
financial and non-financial business practices and procedures and that applies to the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and certain other employees of the Company
responsible for accounting and financial reporting. Both of these documents are available on the Investor section of the Company's website (www.cephalon.com/investor/index.html). The Company intends

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Does the Company have a mandatory retirement age for directors?  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. The Nominating Committee conducts a rigorous evaluation of the Board, its committees and the individual directors annually that it believes provides a sound
basis for determining if each director continues to be an active and positive contributor to the Board. Directors who do not actively and positively contribute to the Board, regardless of age, will
not be nominated for re-election at the Annual Meeting. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Does the Company have a Pre-Approval Policy regarding independent auditor services?  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Sarbanes-Oxley, the Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of the Company's independent auditor. As part
of this responsibility, the Audit Committee is required to pre-approve the audit and non-audit services performed by the independent auditor in order to assure that the

an independent auditor may not provide to its audit client, as well as the audit committee's administration of the engagement of the independent auditor. Accordingly, the Audit Committee has adopted,
and the Board has ratified, the Audit and Non-Audit Pre-Approval Policy that sets forth the procedures and conditions pursuant to which services proposed to be performed by the
independent auditor may be pre-approved. </FONT></P>

Pre-Approval Policy provides for the annual pre-approval of specifically described categories of services (Audit, Audit-Related, Tax and All Other) to be

the Audit Committee must specifically pre-approve the service and its expected range of fees. The policy also delegates pre-approval authority to the Chair of the Audit

<BR></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE    <BR>    </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors is composed of three independent directors and operates under a written charter adopted by the Board that
is designed to comply with rules adopted by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc and the SEC. A copy of the written charter is included as </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Annex
A</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> to this Proxy Statement and also available on the investor information section of the Company's website (www.cephalon.com/investor/index.html). The current members of the
Audit Committee are Mr.&nbsp;Winger (chair), Mr.&nbsp;Egan and Dr.&nbsp;Wilensky. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management
is responsible for the preparation, presentation and integrity of the Company's financial statements, accounting and financial reporting principles, internal controls and
procedures designed to ensure compliance with accounting standards, applicable laws and regulations. The Company's independent public accountants are responsible for performing an independent audit of
the Company's
consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and issuing a report thereon. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes,
including the recommendation to the Board of Directors of the selection of the Company's independent accountants. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Audit Committee members are not professional accountants or auditors, and their functions are not intended to duplicate or to certify the activities of management and the independent
auditor, nor can the Audit Committee certify that the independent auditor is "independent" under applicable rules. The Audit Committee serves a Board-level oversight role, in which it provides advice,
counsel and direction to management and the auditors on the basis of the information it receives, discussions with management and the auditors and the experience of the Committee's members in
business, financial and accounting matters. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
this context, the Audit Committee has met and held discussions with management and the independent accountants, including meetings with the independent accountants during which
management was not present. Management represented to the Audit Committee that the Company's consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial statements with management and the independent accountants. The Audit Committee discussed with the independent
accountants matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No.&nbsp;61 (Communication with Audit Committees). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company's independent accountants also provided to the Audit Committee the written disclosures required by Independence Standards Board Standard No.&nbsp;1 (Independence
Discussions with Audit Committees), and the Audit Committee discussed with the independent accountants that firm's independence. </FONT></P>

<BR></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>COMPENSATION OF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS    <BR>    </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Report of the Stock Option and Compensation Committee  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stock Option and Compensation Committee (the "Committee") annually reviews the performance and total compensation package for all executive
officers, considers the modification of existing compensation and employee benefit programs and the adoption of new plans, administers the Company's equity compensation plans and reviews the
compensation and benefits of non-employee members of the Board of Directors. In connection with these duties, the Committee retains an independent compensation consulting firm to assist it
in its development and evaluation of compensation policies and programs and determinations of compensation awards. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Committee is composed of three non-employee directors, each of whom is deemed to be independent under the listing standards of the NASDAQ National Market. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Executive Compensation Philosophy  </I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee's executive compensation philosophy is based on two complementary beliefs: </FONT></P>

<UL>
<DL compact>
<DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>a
well-designed compensation program should align the goals of stockholders with the goals of the executive; and
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>a
significant part of an executive's compensation, over the long term, should be dependent upon the value created for stockholders. </FONT></DD></DL>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Committee believes that by placing greater weight on variable pay incentives and longer-term compensation, rather than base salary compensation, it will more effectively
align the interests of executives with the Company's stockholders. Furthermore, this emphasis enables the Company to attract executives who are willing to sacrifice current earnings and the retirement
benefits generally offered by larger employers for potential long-term gains in a less stable and riskier environment. The Committee believes that stockholders of Cephalon share a similar
risk profile. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the shorter-term, the Committee believes that tying current compensation to shorter-term strategic goals is a necessary corollary to the
longer-term focus and design of the Company's compensation plan. These shorter-term strategic goals are adopted each year by the Committee as part of the Company's Management
Incentive Compensation Program (MICP). The MICP goals include the achievement of product sales and earnings targets, as well as goals for operational components in the areas of clinical, manufacturing
and research and development. The Committee expects that the achievement of these goals ultimately will contribute to the long-term success of the enterprise. Moreover, the Committee
believes that by making a meaningful portion of the executive's current compensation dependent upon achieving and exceeding corporate objectives, it further aligns the interest of executives with
stockholders. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
considering the appropriate level of compensation for the Company's executives, the Committee recognizes that, in the short-term, the market price of the Company's stock
will be affected by many factors, some of which may be transient in nature and beyond the control of the Company's executives. This is especially true in the biotechnology industry, which is
characterized by a large number of small companies, long product lead times, highly volatile stock prices and, currently, few commercial products. In such an environment, external events, such as
negative financial and clinical reports from other members of the biotechnology industry, can have a marked adverse effect on the stock prices of companies within the industry, including Cephalon. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Executive Compensation Components  </I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee has established three principal categories of compensation for executives: </FONT></P>

<UL>
<DL compact>
<DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>base

incentives consisting of incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options (collectively, "Stock Options") and stock awards ("Stock
Awards"). </FONT></DD></DL>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
making compensation decisions with respect to each of these categories, the Committee considers the competitive market for executives and compensation levels provided by comparable
biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. To do this, the Company conducts and subscribes to a number of compensation surveys. The surveys used for these purposes were provided by outside
consultants and do not specifically attribute the data to participating companies. Primary comparisons were made with companies of similar revenue size, stage of development, number of employees, and
levels of performance. Many of the survey participants are included in the Index of NASDAQ Pharmaceutical Stocks used in the Comparative Stock Performance Graph on page&nbsp;24 of this proxy
statement. The Committee also utilizes its independent compensation consultant to review the Company's compensation and equity programs and incentive bonus awards made to executives for 2005. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Base Salary.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salaries for experienced executives of biotechnology companies in the
Philadelphia metropolitan area are heavily influenced by the salaries paid by the large pharmaceutical companies that maintain executive staffs in the region. The Company routinely competes against
these companies in trying to attract qualified candidates and has successfully induced most of its current executives to leave such organizations. The base salaries of Cephalon's executives are set
below those levels that would be achieved by executives with similar levels of authority and experience in larger pharmaceutical companies and above the average of those companies of comparable
revenue size. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Committee reviews executive base salaries at the end of each year, with any adjustments to base salary becoming effective on January&nbsp;1 of the succeeding year. During this
review, the Committee considers, in addition to the information provided by the salary surveys, the individual executive's contribution to the Company's achievements and changes in role and
responsibility of the executive during the year. Because the Company is experiencing rapid growth and internal change, particular care is taken to ensure that expanded responsibilities are recognized
in the calculation of base salary. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annual Incentive Bonus.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's incentive compensation consists of the MICP. Under the
program, Company and individual goals are established at the beginning of the year, and include targets for progress in all significant aspects of the Company's business. For Dr.&nbsp;Baldino, the
MICP goals consist of a financial component (60%, split equally between sales and earnings targets) and an operational component (40%). For the other executive officers, MICP goals consist of
individual performance goals (70%) and financial goals (30%). The target bonus level for Dr.&nbsp;Baldino in 2005 was 100% of his base salary and any awards granted could range from 15% to 300% of
his base salary. For
the other executive officers, the target bonus levels were set at 50% of base salary and any awards granted could range from 15% to 110% of base salary. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
the end of the fiscal year, the Committee measures actual performance (company-wide and individual) against the goals set out for Dr.&nbsp;Baldino in the MICP to
determine the appropriate adjustment to the target bonus. The Committee's determination is then ratified by the full Board of Directors (excluding Dr.&nbsp;Baldino). For the other executive
officers, Dr.&nbsp;Baldino will assess the actual performance of each officer against his respective performance goals and will recommend any award under the MICP. The Committee will then review and
approve these awards. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-Term Incentives.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-term incentives for officers and directors
have been provided by means of periodic grants of Stock Options and Stock Awards under the Company's 2004 Equity Compensation Plan. Officers and directors are not eligible to participate in the 2000
Equity Compensation Plan for Employees and Key Advisors. </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stock Options:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stock Options have exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the underlying shares of Common Stock on the date
of grant, vest over a four-year period and expire ten years from the date of grant. The Committee considers Stock Options to be a valuable and necessary compensation tool that aligns the
long-term financial interests of the Company's executives with the financial interests of its stockholders. Further, the vesting provisions of the Plans serve to retain qualified
employees, providing continuing benefits to the Company beyond </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stock Awards:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee considers Stock Awards to be a valuable and necessary component of the Company's long-term
incentives, and that such awards should be reserved for the highest levels of performance and accomplishments. The Stock Awards contain vesting provisions that lapse over four years at the rate of 25%
per year, on the anniversary date of the award. No dividends will be paid on such shares until they are vested. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Chief Executive Officer Compensation  </I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Base Salary:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2005, the base salary of Dr.&nbsp;Baldino, the Company's
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, was increased to $1,129,000 from $1,065,000, effective January&nbsp;1, 2006. The Committee, with the assistance and advice of its independent compensation
consultant, reviewed the results of a survey of executive salaries at other publicly traded biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies of similar size, focus, and stage of development and established
Dr.&nbsp;Baldino's salary within
the upper half of the range of the comparison group. The Committee made this adjustment after reviewing the progress made by the Company during 2005, as described previously under "Overview of 2005
Achievements." The Committee noted that, among other things, Cephalon continued to expand its worldwide operations in scope and complexity during the year, and that Dr.&nbsp;Baldino's role had
expanded in scope and importance commensurately. The Committee also noted that there was considerable progress in organizational development with the strengthening of the management team through the
addition of experienced executives in medical affairs, clinical research and the worldwide sales and marketing organizations. Additionally, significant progress was made towards building a fully-
integrated oncology company in 2005. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annual Incentive Bonus:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his performance during 2005, Dr.&nbsp;Baldino was granted an
annual cash incentive bonus of $1,214,100 under the MICP. The Committee reviewed achievements against the pre-established objectives, noting that the Company's previously discussed
exceptionally strong performance in 2005 was a significant factor in establishing Dr.&nbsp;Baldino's bonus at slightly above his MICP target level. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-Term Incentives:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee also granted to Dr.&nbsp;Baldino Stock
Options to purchase 160,000 shares of Common Stock and a Restricted Stock Award of 80,000 shares of Common Stock. In granting Dr.&nbsp;Baldino's award, the Committee considered it important that the
Company provide a continuing long-term incentive for the retention of Dr.&nbsp;Baldino's services. The Committee also awarded this grant in recognition of the Company's significant
accomplishments in 2005. The Committee believes that the achievement of both short and long-term objectives over the next few years will place considerable demands on Dr.&nbsp;Baldino
and the rest of the executive team, and that the retention and motivation of these individuals is crucial to building long-term value for stockholders. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
February&nbsp;2006, the Committee also granted Dr.&nbsp;Baldino a Restricted Stock Award of 5,000 shares of Common Stock in recognition of his critical role in settling the patent
infringement lawsuits related to PROVIGIL and ACTIQ in late 2005 and early 2006. Because the final settlement occurred in 2006, the Committee considers this grant to be part of Dr.&nbsp;Baldino's

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Base Salaries:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee believes that the accomplishments described above under the
caption "Overview of 2005 Achievements" and the achievement of individual objectives justified increases to executive base salaries for 2006. Executive base salary increases effective on
January&nbsp;1, 2006 ranged from 4% to 19% of base salary. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annual Incentive Bonus:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the Company's performance in 2005 and the individual
performance of the executive officers, the Committee approved annual incentive bonus awards ranging from 50% to 110% of base salary. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-Term Incentives:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee granted each of the Company's Executive
Officers Stock Options to purchase 50,000 shares and Restricted Stock Awards of 15,000 shares of Common Stock. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;401(k) Plan:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2005, the Committee continued the Company's historical practice of making
Company-matching contributions for all eligible employees under the 401(k) Plan, including the executive team. The Company-matching contribution consisted of $1.00 in cash for each $1.00 of employee
contributions under the 401(k) Plan. Matching contributions are made only on employee contributions of up to 6% of the employee's compensation and are subject to further limitations imposed by the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Because Cephalon does not sponsor a defined benefit pension plan, the 401(k) Plan matching contribution allows Cephalon to remain competitive
with other companies in its industry that provide retirement savings vehicles for their executives and employees. Cephalon employees are immediately and fully vested in all matching contributions
under the 401(k) Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deferred Compensation Plan:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Company's existing deferred compensation plan for
executives, individuals holding the title of Vice President or higher may defer receipt to a future year of all, or a portion, of any annual bonus. On an annual basis, the Committee determines the
rate of interest to be paid on the deferred amounts. In 2005, the rate of interest was 10%, and will continue at that rate in 2006. Only two of the Company's Executive Officers participate in the
deferred compensation plan; total assets in the plan with respect to these individuals are approximately $2&nbsp;million. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Split-Dollar Life Arrangements:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2001, the Company determined to provide split-dollar life
insurance arrangements to the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Senior Vice Presidents. These arrangements provided for a $15,000,000 death benefit for the Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer and a $2,000,000 death benefit for each of the Senior Vice Presidents. Under the terms of the arrangements, the Company paid a portion of the policy premiums on the split-dollar life
insurance policy, and retained a collateral interest in the policy. However, since the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley Act in July&nbsp;2002, the Company has not made any additional payments under the
split-dollar arrangements. As a result of the uncertainty under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding whether premium
contributions to split-dollar agreements are permissible, the Company determined to terminate all of its split-dollar agreements, effective February&nbsp;2004. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;162(m) Limitations:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code limits the deduction
that may be claimed by a "public company" for compensation paid to certain individuals to $1,000,000, except to the extent that any excess compensation qualifies as "performance-based compensation."
In accordance with current regulations, the amounts received upon the exercise of Stock Options granted under the 2004 Plan will qualify as "performance-based compensation," but the value of the
shares received when Stock Awards become transferable and not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture will not qualify as "performance-based compensation." Payments under the Company's annual
incentive plans described above also are generally subject to the Section&nbsp;162(m) limits on deductibility and will not qualify as "performance-based compensation," within the meaning of the
applicable regulations. </FONT></P>

amounts shown include Company matching contributions during calendar years 2003, 2004 and 2005 under the Cephalon,&nbsp;Inc. 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan, which covers all of the
Company's eligible employees. For 2003, all other compensation also includes compensation income recognized by the executive in connection with the split-dollar life insurance arrangement the Company
entered into with each executive in 2001. Since the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in July&nbsp;2002, the Company has not made any additional premium contributions to the life insurance policies
underlying the split-dollar arrangement because of the uncertainty regarding whether such premium contributions are permissible under the Act. In February&nbsp;2004, as a result of the continued
uncertainty regarding the permissibility of such future premium contributions, the Company terminated the split-dollar life insurance arrangement with each executive. For the period between
July&nbsp;2002 and February&nbsp;2004, the current life insurance premiums that were due on the underlying life insurance policies were paid from the cash surrender value portion of the policies.
See page 16 for a summary of these split-dollar arrangements. The compensation recognized in 2003 under the split-dollar life insurance arrangements for each executive is as follows:
Dr.&nbsp;Baldino $11,867; Dr.&nbsp;Blake $2,345; Mr.&nbsp;Buchi $1,402; Mr.&nbsp;Osborn $1,241; and Mr.&nbsp;Roche $1,402.

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;25, 2002, the Company entered into an Executive Severance Agreement with Dr.&nbsp;Frank Baldino, Jr., its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
The agreement provides for compensation and benefits in the event that Dr.&nbsp;Baldino's employment with the Company is terminated prior to a change in control of the Company, on account of a
change in control of the Company or on account of a disability, as defined in the agreement. If termination results prior to a change in control of the Company, Dr.&nbsp;Baldino will receive a lump
sum payment equal to the sum of (i)&nbsp;three times his annual base salary at the rate in effect immediately before his termination date, (ii)&nbsp;three times his annual bonus, and
(iii)&nbsp;the pro rata portion of his annual bonus, based on the number of months worked in the calendar year in which the termination occurs. In addition, Dr.&nbsp;Baldino, and his spouse and
dependents, if applicable, will continue to receive the medical and dental coverage in effect on his termination date for a period of 36&nbsp;months. Dr.&nbsp;Baldino will have outplacement
assistance services provided in an amount not to exceed $15,000. If termination results on account of a change in control of the Company, Dr.&nbsp;Baldino will receive the same payments and benefits
as above. However, all of Dr.&nbsp;Baldino's stock options and restricted stock held will become fully vested and/or exercisable and will remain exercisable as set forth in the applicable option
agreements with the Company. The agreement provides that Dr.&nbsp;Baldino will be grossed-up for any payments he receives in connection with a change in control of the Company if such
payments would cause him to pay the excise tax under Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code. If termination results on account of a disability, Dr.&nbsp;Baldino will only be entitled to receive disability
benefits under any disability program maintained by the Company that covers executives, and Dr.&nbsp;Baldino's employment will not be considered to have terminated under the Executive Severance
Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
January&nbsp;31, 2006, the Board approved, subject to stockholder approval at the Annual Meeting, an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, by amending
Article FOURTH thereof, to increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock by 550,000,000 shares from 200,000,000 shares to 750,000,000 shares ("Item 2"). Each additional share of Common
Stock authorized by Item 2 will have the same rights and privileges as each share of Common Stock presently authorized. Stockholders have no preemptive rights to receive or purchase any of the
additional shares of Common Stock authorized by the proposed amendment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Board believes that the availability of the additional shares of Common Stock for the purposes stated will be beneficial to the Company by increasing the flexibility of its business
and financial planning. While the Company has no present plans to issue the additional authorized shares of Common Stock, the proposed increase in the number of authorized shares of Common Stock will
ensure that shares will be available, if needed, for issuance in connection with stock dividends or splits, raising additional capital, making acquisitions, granting additional stock options and for
other corporate purposes that the Board determines are advisable. </FONT></P>

Item 2 is approved by the stockholders, the Board will have the authority to issue the additional authorized shares of Common Stock, or any part thereof, without further action by the
stockholders except as required by law or applicable requirements of self-regulatory organizations. For example, the NASDAQ National Market, on which the Company's Common Stock is listed,
currently requires stockholder approval prior to the listing of additional shares in several instances, including acquisition transactions where the present or potential issuance of shares could
result in a 20% or greater increase in the number of shares outstanding. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
Item 2 could have an anti-takeover effect, although that is not its intention. For example, if the Company were the subject of a hostile takeover attempt, it could try
to impede the takeover by issuing shares of Common Stock, thereby diluting the voting power of the other outstanding shares and increasing the potential cost of the takeover. The availability of this
defensive strategy to the Company could discourage unsolicited takeover attempts, thereby limiting the opportunity for the Company's stockholders to realize a higher price for their shares than is
generally available in the public markets. The Board is not aware of any attempt, or contemplated attempt, to acquire control of the Company, and this proposal is not being presented with the intent
that it be utilized as a type of anti-takeover device. In addition to the Company's Common Stock, the Company's Certificate of Incorporation currently empowers the Board to authorize the
issuance of one or more series of preferred stock </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
January&nbsp;31, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors adopted, subject to stockholder approval at this Annual Meeting, an amendment to the 2004 Plan that would
increase by 1,750,000 shares the total number of shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance under the 2004 Plan from 9,700,000 shares to 11,450,000 shares. This amendment provides that no more
than 600,000 of the additional 1,750,000 shares may be granted as Stock Awards. The Board of Directors has directed that the proposal to increase the number of shares of Common Stock authorized for
issuance under the 2004 Plan be submitted to the Company's stockholders for their approval ("Item 3"). If approved by stockholders, the increase in the number of shares authorized for issuance under
the 2004 Plan will become effective on May&nbsp;17, 2006. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of March&nbsp;22, 2006, there are only 165,867 shares available for issuance under the 2004 Plan. The Compensation Committee believes that this number is not sufficient in view of
the Company's compensation structure and strategy. The Compensation Committee has concluded that the Company's ability to attract, retain and motivate top quality management and employees is material
to the Company's success and would be enhanced by the Company's continued ability to grant equity compensation. In addition, the Compensation Committee believes that the interests of the Company and
its stockholders will be advanced if the Company can continue to offer its employees and non-employee directors the opportunity to acquire or increase their proprietary interests in the
Company. The Compensation Committee believes that the availability of the additional 1,750,000 shares of Common Stock will ensure that the Company continues to have a sufficient number of shares of
Common Stock authorized for issuance under the 2004 Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrent
with its approval of the increase in the total number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2004 Plan, the Compensation Committee also made the following modifications

shares of Common Stock, only 600,000 shares may be issued pursuant to Stock Awards. If, prior to the end of their original term, Stock Options granted under the 2004 Plan terminate or are cancelled,

that the maximum aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be granted pursuant to Stock Options to any individual during a calendar year is 500,000 shares. </FONT></P>

Directors. The Compensation Committee has the sole authority to (i)&nbsp;determine the persons to whom Stock Options and/or Stock Awards may be granted under the 2004 Plan, (ii)&nbsp;determine the
type, size and other terms and conditions of each grant, (iii)&nbsp;determine the time when the grants will be made and the duration of any applicable exercise or restriction period, including the
criteria for exercisability and the acceleration of exercisability, (iv)&nbsp;amend the terms of any previously issued grant, so long as no previously granted Stock Option is repriced, replaced, or
regranted through cancellation, or by lowering the exercise price of a previously granted Stock Option,
unless the stockholders of the Company provide prior approval, and (v)&nbsp;deal with any other matters arising under the 2004 Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grants.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All grants are subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the 2004 Plan and to those other terms and conditions
consistent with the 2004 Plan as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate and as are specified in writing by the Compensation Committee to the designated individual (the "Grant Notice"). Grants
under the 2004 Plan need not be uniform as among other recipients of the same type of grant. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility for Participation.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the employees of the Company and its subsidiaries and advisors and consultants of the
Company and its subsidiaries are eligible for grants under the 2004 Plan. The Compensation Committee determines which employees and consultants will receive grants under the 2004 Plan.
Non-employee directors of the Company also are eligible to receive grants under the 2004 Plan. As of March&nbsp;22, 2006, approximately 129 employees and seven non-employee
directors were eligible for grants under the 2004 Plan; it is not possible to specify in advance the number of advisors and consultants who may be eligible for grants. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stock Options.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Compensation Committee may grant Stock Options intended to qualify as incentive stock options ("ISOs")
within the meaning of section&nbsp;422 of the Code or so-called "non-qualified stock options" that are not intended to so qualify ("NQSOs") or any combination of ISOs or
NQSOs. Non-employee directors, consultants and advisors only receive NQSOs. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Compensation Committee fixes the exercise price per share on the date of grant. The exercise price of any NQSO or ISO granted under the 2004 Plan may not be less than the fair market
value of the underlying shares of Common Stock on the date of grant. The current measure of fair market value on a particular date is the closing sale price of a share of Common Stock as reported on
the NASDAQ National Market on that date. However, if the grantee of an ISO is a person who holds more than 10% of the combined voting power of all classes of outstanding stock of the Company, the
exercise price per share of an ISO must be at least 110% of the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant. To the extent that the aggregate fair market value of shares of

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Compensation Committee determines the term of each Stock Option; provided, however, that the exercise period may not exceed ten years from the date of grant and, if the grantee of an
ISO is a person who holds more than 10% of the combined voting power of all classes of outstanding stock of the Company, the term may not exceed five years from the date of grant. The vesting period
for Stock Options commences on the date of grant and ends on such date as is determined by the Compensation
Committee, in its sole discretion, which is specified in the Grant Notice. A grantee may exercise a Stock Option by delivering notice of exercise to the Compensation Committee and pay the exercise
price (i)&nbsp;in cash, (ii)&nbsp;with approval of the Compensation Committee, by delivering shares of Common Stock already owned by the grantee and having a fair market value on the date of
exercise equal to the exercise price, or through attestation to ownership of such shares, or (iii)&nbsp;by such other method as the Compensation Committee may approve. The grantee must pay, at the
time of exercise, the exercise price and the amount of any applicable federal, state or local withholding tax due in connection with such Stock Option exercise at the time specified by the
Compensation Committee. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formula Grants to Non-employee Directors.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-employee directors of the Company will automatically
receive, without the exercise of discretion by the Compensation Committee, annual grants of NQSOs. Under the 2004 Plan, each non-employee director will receive a grant of a NQSO to
purchase 15,000 shares of Common Stock immediately upon his or her first becoming a member of the Board of Directors (whether by election or appointment) and will receive a grant of a NQSO to purchase
10,000 shares of Common Stock upon their annual re-election to the Board. The date of grant of such annual grants will be the date of the Annual Meeting. The Board of Directors has the
authority to determine the terms of these grants to non-employee directors. Generally, all NQSOs granted to non-employee directors are fully exercisable on the date of grant
with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of the Company's Common Stock on the date of the grant. However, annual grants made prior to May&nbsp;5, 2002 to non-employee
directors vest over a four-year period. The Board of Directors may also grant NQSOs to non-employee directors in addition to the automatic grants described above. Currently,
seven non-employee directors are entitled to receive automatic grants of NQSOs and are eligible to receive discretionary NQSO grants under the 2004 Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stock Awards.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Compensation Committee may issue shares of Common Stock under a Stock Award for such cash consideration, if
any, as is determined by the Compensation Committee. Non-employee directors are not eligible for Stock Awards under the 2004 Plan. The number of shares of Common Stock granted to each
grantee is determined by the Compensation Committee. The Grant Notice may provide for a period during which the Stock Award will remain subject to certain restrictions, including restrictions on
transferability (the "Restriction Period"). During the Restriction Period, a grantee may not sell, assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of the shares of Common Stock to which such Restriction
Period applies, except to a successor grantee in the event of the grantee's death. Unless the Compensation Committee determines otherwise, if a grantee's employment terminates or if a grantee who is

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal Income Tax Consequences.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is a brief description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences generally
arising with respect to grants that may be awarded under the 2004 Plan. This discussion is intended for the information of the stockholders considering how to vote at the Annual Meeting and not as tax
guidance to individuals who participate in the 2004 Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
grant of an ISO or NQSO will create no tax consequence for the grantee or the Company. A grantee will not recognize taxable income upon exercising an ISO (except that the alternative
minimum tax may apply), and the Company will receive no deduction at that time. Upon exercising an NQSO, the grantee must generally recognize ordinary income equal to the difference between the
exercise price and the fair market value of the freely transferable and non-forfeitable shares received. The Company generally will be entitled to a deduction equal to the amount
recognized as ordinary income by the grantee. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
grantee's disposition of shares acquired upon the exercise of an option generally will result in capital gain or loss measured by the difference between the sale price and the
grantee's tax basis in such shares (the exercise price of the option in the case of shares acquired by exercise of an ISO and held for the applicable ISO holding periods). Generally, there will be no
tax consequence to the Company in connection with a disposition of shares acquired under an option, except that the Company will be entitled to a deduction (and the grantee will recognize ordinary
income) if shares acquired upon exercise of an ISO are disposed of before the applicable ISO holding periods are satisfied. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
respect to grants of Stock Awards under the 2004 Plan that are either not restricted as to transferability or not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, the grantee must
generally recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the shares received less any amounts paid for the shares. The Company generally will be entitled to a deduction for the same
amount. With respect to Stock Awards involving shares that are restricted as to transferability and subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, the grantee must generally recognize ordinary income
equal to the fair market value of the shares received at the time that the shares become transferable or not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, whichever occurs earlier. The Company
generally will be entitled to a deduction in an amount equal to the ordinary income recognized by the grantee. A grantee may elect to be taxed at the time of receipt of the grant of such restricted
shares rather than upon the lapse of the restriction on transferability or the substantial risk of forfeiture, but if the grantee subsequently forfeits the shares, the grantee would not be entitled to
any tax deduction, including a capital loss, for the value of the shares on which the grantee previously paid tax. Such election must be made and filed with the Internal Revenue Service within thirty
(30)&nbsp;days after the date of the grant. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;162(m)
of the Code generally disallows a public corporation's tax deduction for compensation paid to its chief executive officer and any of its four other most highly
compensated officers in excess of $1,000,000 in any year. Compensation that qualifies as "performance-based compensation" is excluded from the $1,000,000 deductibility cap, and therefore remains fully
deductible by the corporation that pays it. The Company intends that Stock Options granted under the 2004 Plan by the Compensation Committee will qualify as "performance-based compensation." Stock
Awards granted under the 2004 Plan will not qualify as "performance-based compensation." </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>approval.
Amendments to the 2000 Plan, including amendments increasing the number of shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under the 2000 Plan, also did not require approval of the Company's
stockholders. In light of changes to the NASDAQ stockholder approval requirements for stock option plans, the Board has decided that it will not further increase the number of shares authorized for
issuance under the 2000 Plan, but will continue to use any shares authorized for issuance under the 2000 Plan for future grants until the 2000 Plan expires according to its terms in 2010. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
purpose of the 2000 Plan is to promote the Company's success by linking the personal interests of the Company's non-executive employees and consultants and advisors to
those of the Company's stockholders and by providing grantees with an incentive for outstanding performance. The 2000 Plan currently authorizes the granting of NQSOs only. The 2000 Plan is
administered and interpreted by the Compensation Committee of the Board. The Compensation Committee determines the individuals who will receive a NQSO grant under the 2000 Plan, the number of shares
of Common Stock subject to the NQSO, the period during which the NQSO becomes exercisable, the term of the NQSO (but not to exceed 10&nbsp;years from the date of grant) and the other terms and
conditions of the NQSO consistent with the terms of the 2000 Plan. All of the NQSOs that are currently outstanding under the 2000 Plan become exercisable ratably over a four-year period
beginning on the date of grant and expire ten years from the date of grant. The exercise price of a NQSO granted under the 2000 Plan will be determined by the Compensation Committee, but may not be
less than the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. A grantee may exercise a NQSO granted under the 2000 Plan by delivering notice of exercise to the Compensation Committee
and pay the exercise price (i)&nbsp;in cash, (ii)&nbsp;with approval of the Compensation Committee, by delivering shares of Common Stock already owned by the grantee and having a fair market value
on the date of exercise
equal to the exercise price, or through attestation to ownership of such shares, or (iii)&nbsp;through such other method as the Compensation Committee may approve. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Board has the authority to amend or terminate the 2000 Plan at any time without stockholder approval. The 2000 Plan will terminate on December&nbsp;12, 2010, unless it is
terminated earlier by the Board or is extended by the Board. No amendment or termination of the 2000 Plan may adversely affect any option previously granted under the 2000 Plan without the written
consent of the grantee, unless required by applicable law. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
consequences described above under the description of the 2004 Plan with respect to a "Corporate Transaction/Change in Control of the Company" also apply to outstanding NQSOs under

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board, on the recommendation of the Audit Committee, has reappointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accountants for the year
ending December&nbsp;31, 2006, and has further directed that management submit the selection of PwC as independent registered public accountants for ratification by the stockholders at the Annual
Meeting. Stockholder ratification of the selection of PwC as the Company's independent registered public accountants is not required by Cephalon's bylaws, Delaware corporate law or otherwise. The
Board has elected to seek such ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. Should the stockholders fail to ratify the selection of PwC as independent registered public accountants, the Board
will reconsider whether to retain that firm for fiscal 2006. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PwC
has audited the Company's financial statements since their appointment in June&nbsp;2002. Representatives of PwC are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting, will have an
opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. </FONT></P>

accordance with the Company's bylaws, the persons named in the proxies will vote the shares represented thereby in accordance with their judgment on such matters. The chairman of the meeting may

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>"Householding" of Proxy Materials  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cephalon has adopted a method of delivery for its proxy statement and annual report called "householding" to stockholders. Under this method, the Company delivers
only one copy of the proxy materials to one or more stockholders who share the same last name and address (and do not participate in electronic delivery), unless such stockholders have notified the
Company that they wish to continue to receive multiple copies. Cephalon adopted the householding method to reduce the amount of duplicative material that its stockholders receive and to lower printing
and mailing costs. Householding is in effect for the 2006 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and will remain in effect for all future Annual Meetings. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you are a registered stockholder who previously received multiple copies and wish to continue to receive multiple copies of the Company's proxy materials at the same address,
additional copies will be provided to you upon request. You may request multiple copies by notifying the Company in writing or verbally that you wish to opt out of the householding program at Investor
Relations, Cephalon,&nbsp;Inc., 41 Moores Road, Frazer, Pennsylvania 19355, (610)&nbsp;738-6376. You may opt out of householding at any time prior to 30&nbsp;days prior to the
mailing of proxy materials in April of each year. If you own the Company's common stock in nominee name (such as through a broker), please notify your broker if you wish to continue to receive
multiple copies of the proxy materials. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Proxy Solicitation Costs  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the use of the mails, proxies may be solicited by telephone by officers, directors and a small number of regular employees of the Company who will
not be specially compensated for such services. The Company also has requested banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to solicit proxies from beneficial owners, where
appropriate, and will reimburse such persons for reasonable expenses incurred in that regard. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Advance Notice Provisions  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Company's bylaws, no business may be brought before an Annual Meeting unless it is specified in the notice of the meeting or is otherwise brought before
the meeting at the direction of the Board or by a stockholder entitled to vote who has delivered written notice to the Secretary of the Company not earlier than the close of business on the one
hundred and twentieth day nor later than the close of business on the ninetieth day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's Annual Meeting. In addition, any stockholder who wishes to
submit a nomination to the Board must deliver written notice of the nomination with this time period and comply with the information requirements in the bylaws relating to stockholder nominations. See
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Governance of the Company&#151;How does the Board select nominees for the Board?"</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> for additional information about stockholder nominations.
These requirements are separate from and in addition to requirements that a stockholder must meet in order to have a stockholder proposal included in the Company's proxy statement. </FONT></P>

an open avenue of communication among the independent auditors, financial and senior management, the Board of Directors and Internal Audit. </FONT></DD></DL>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consistent
with these duties and functions, the Audit Committee should encourage continuous improvement of, and should foster adherence to, the Company's policies, procedures and
practices at all levels. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Audit Committee has the authority to retain at the Company's expense, special legal, accounting, or other consultants or experts it deems necessary in the performance of its duties
and responsibilities. In addition, the Audit Committee has the authority to conduct any investigation it deems necessary in fulfilling its duties and responsibilities. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COMPOSITION  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Audit Committee shall be comprised of three or more directors as determined by the Board, each of whom shall be a non-executive director and free
from any relationship that, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere with the exercise of his or her independent judgment as a member of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee members also shall
meet the independence, financial literacy and other requirements of all applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and of the principal market(s) or automated quotation
system (e.g., Nasdaq) on which the Company's securities are traded or quoted (the "Exchanges"). </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each
member of the Audit Committee shall be able to read and understand financial statements, including a company's balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement. In addition,
at least one member of the Audit Committee shall have past employment experience in finance or accounting, requisite professional certification in accounting, or any other comparable experience or
background which results in that member's financial sophistication, including being or having been a chief executive officer, chief financial officer or other senior officer with financial oversight
responsibilities. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
members of the Audit Committee shall be elected by the Board following the annual meeting of the Stockholders and shall serve until their successors shall be duly elected and
qualified. The Chair of the Audit Committee shall be elected by the Board. </FONT></P>

and to all members of the Company's Board. Copies of the minutes are to be provided to the independent auditors. As part of its job to foster open communication, the Audit Committee should
meet privately in executive session at least annually with management, the director of the Internal Audit, the independent auditors, and as a Committee to discuss any matters that the Audit Committee
or each of these groups believes should be discussed privately. In addition, the Audit Committee or at least its Chair should meet with the independent auditors and management quarterly to review the
Company's financial statements and significant findings based upon the auditors' limited review procedures. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Audit Committee's primary responsibility is one of oversight and it recognizes that the Company's management is responsible for preparing the Company's
financial statements and that the independent auditors are responsible for auditing those financial statements. In addition, the Audit Committee recognizes that financial management, including the
Internal Audit staff, as well as the independent auditors, have more time, knowledge and more detailed information on the Company than do Audit Committee members; consequently, in carrying out its
oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee is not providing any expert or special assurance as to the Company's financial statements or any professional certification as to the independent
auditors' work. </FONT></P>
