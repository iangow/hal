If you do not receive the legal proxy in time, bring your brokerage statement with you to the meeting so that the Company can verify your ownership of the Company&#146;s stock on the record date and admit you to the meeting.

Abstentions and &#147;broker non-votes&#148; (shares held by a broker, bank or other nominee that does not have authority, either express or discretionary, to vote on a particular matter) are counted for determining whether there is a quorum. </P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">If a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting, the six nominees for director receiving the greatest number of votes (a plurality) will be elected.

<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">The telephone and internet voting procedures are designed to authenticate stockholders&#146; identities, to allow stockholders to vote their shares and to confirm that their instructions have been properly recorded.

<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">Our Board of Directors currently consists of seven members: Scott R. Silverman, William J. Caragol, Jeffrey S. Cobb, Barry M. Edelstein, Steven R. Foland, Michael E. Krawitz and Ned L. Siegel. Our Board of Directors has determined that five of our seven directors, Messrs. Cobb, Edelstein, Foland, Krawitz and Siegel, are independent under the standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market. &nbsp;&nbsp;For transactions, relationships or arrangements that were considered by the Board of Directors in determining the independence of our Board of Directors, please see &#147;Certain Relationships and Related Transactions &#151; Director and Officer Roles and Relationships&#148; below.</P>

<P style="margin-top:3.533px; margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:48px">Our chief executive officer, Mr. Silverman, also currently serves as the Chairman of our Board of Directors. &nbsp;Our Board of Directors has determined to not maintain a lead independent director at this time. &nbsp;The Board of Directors believes its leadership structure is appropriate in helping guide us through our transition in to a next generation healthcare and information management company. &nbsp;In addition, as discussed below, we have three standing Board of Directors committees, all of which are comprised entirely of independent directors. We believe that this leadership structure has been effective for us by providing clear and unified leadership through a single chief executive officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors, but whose power is balanced by having independent members on the Board of Directors who, through the presiding committee chairs, have input into the meeting agendas and the other important responsibilities. While we believe this structure is currently the most effective for us, the Board of Directors has no mandatory policy with respect to the separation of the offices of Chairman and the chief executive officer.</P>

<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">Our Board of Directors is responsible for risk oversight as part of its fiduciary duty of care to effectively monitor business operations.&nbsp;Our Board of Directors administers its risk oversight function as a whole and through its committees. For example, the audit committee discusses with management our major risk exposures, their potential financial impact on us and our risk mitigation strategies. In addition, our whistleblower procedure contained in our Code of Conduct and Corporate Ethics General Policy Statement states notice of a financial matter that may be inappropriate should be sent anonymously to the chair of the audit committee. &nbsp;Furthermore, the audit committee and the nominating and governance committee are responsible for the enforcement of our Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers.</P>

We encourage each member of our Board of Directors to attend our Annual Meeting of Stockholders. At our 2010 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, two of our directors were present. </P>

<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">Our Board of Directors has the authority to appoint board committees to perform certain management and administrative functions.

Our Board of Directors has determined that each of the members of our audit committee is &#147;independent,&#148; as defined under, and required by, the federal securities laws and the rules of the SEC, including Rule&nbsp;10A-3(b)(i) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, as well as the listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market. Our Board of Directors has determined that each of Messrs.&nbsp;Foland and Edelstein qualify as an &#147;audit committee financial expert&#148; under applicable federal securities laws and regulations, and has the &#147;financial sophistication&#148; required under the listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market.

<P style="line-height:12pt; margin:0px; text-indent:48px">On March&nbsp;20, 2009, Steel Vault closed a debt financing transaction with Blue Moon for $190,000 pursuant to a secured convertible promissory note. The note was payable on demand after March&nbsp;20, 2011, accrued interest at five percent per year compounded monthly and was secured by substantially all of Steel Vault&#146;s assets pursuant to a security agreement between Steel Vault and Blue Moon. The note could be prepaid at any time without penalty. </P>
<P style="line-height:12pt; margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="line-height:12pt; margin:0px; text-indent:48px">Under the note, Blue Moon had the right, at any time, in its sole discretion to convert the entire unpaid principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest on the note into that number of shares of Steel Vault&#146;s common stock at a price of $0.44 per share. Steel Vault could convert the note into its common stock anytime after a change in control of Steel Vault or if the average of the high and low trading prices of Steel Vault&#146;s common stock as quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board was greater than 120% of the conversion price ($0.44 per share) over 20 consecutive trading days. However, as a condition of our obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, Steel Vault caused the note to be amended on terms reasonably acceptable to us to eliminate the convertible feature of such note. In addition, Blue Moon received a common stock purchase warrant from Steel Vault, which carries piggy-back registration rights, to purchase 108,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $0.44 per share. Following the Merger, the warrant is now exercisable for 54,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $0.88 per share. Steel Vault repaid both the principal and interest accrued thereon on the Blue Moon obligation in full on November&nbsp;10, 2009 in the amounts of $190,000 and $6,000, respectively, and the warrant to purchase our common stock remains outstanding. </P>

<P style="line-height:12pt; margin:0px; text-indent:48px">On June&nbsp;4, 2009, we closed a debt financing transaction with Steel Vault for $500,000 pursuant to a secured convertible promissory note. The two year note was collectible on demand on or after June&nbsp;4, 2010, accrued interest at a rate of twelve percent and was secured by substantially all of Steel Vault&#146;s assets, including the assets of National Credit Report.Com, LLC and the security interest held by us on the assets was senior to any other security interest on the assets pursuant to a Subordination and Intercreditor Agreement between us and Blue Moon. The note could be prepaid at any time without penalty and matured on June&nbsp;4, 2011. The unpaid principal and accrued and unpaid interest under the note could be converted at any time into common stock of Steel Vault at a price of $0.30 per share. The principal was convertible into 1,666,667 shares of Steel Vault common stock. </P>
<P style="line-height:12pt; margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="line-height:12pt; margin:0px; text-indent:48px">The financing transaction included a common stock purchase warrant sold to us to purchase 333,334 common shares of Steel Vault at a price of $0.30 per share, which we refer to as the Steel Vault Warrant. The Steel Vault Warrant was void after June&nbsp;4, 2014. The note and Steel Vault Warrant were issued to us pursuant to a Convertible Note and Warrant Subscription Agreement, dated June&nbsp;4, 2009, between us and Steel Vault, which provided that Steel Vault would file a registration statement for the public resale of the shares underlying the note and Steel Vault Warrant upon notice that we elected to convert all or part of the note into common stock of Steel Vault. </P>

The aggregate amount of shares loaned under any and all Stock Loan Agreements, together with all other shares sold by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to General Instruction I.B.6. to Form S-3, could not exceed one-third of the aggregate market value of the voting and non-voting common equity held by non-affiliates of the Company in any 12&nbsp;month period. R &amp; R Consulting Partners, LLC could demand return of some or all of the borrowed shares (or an equal number of freely tradable shares of common stock) at any time on or after the six-month anniversary date such borrowed shares were loaned to Optimus, but no such demand could be made if there were any shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding. If a permitted return demand was made, Optimus was required to return the borrowed shares (or an equal number of freely tradable shares of common stock) within three trading days after such demand. Optimus could return the borrowed shares in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, without penalty or premium. </P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:11.133px; text-indent:48px">On September&nbsp;29, 2009, October 8, 2009, and October&nbsp;21, 2009, R &amp; R Consulting Partners, LLC loaned Optimus 1.3&nbsp;million, 800,000 and 600,000 shares, respectively, of Company common stock as is further discussed below. </P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:11.133px; text-indent:48px">On September&nbsp;29, 2009, the Company exercised the first tranche of this financing, to issue 296 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, for a tranche amount of approximately $3.0&nbsp;million. In support of this tranche, R &amp; R Consulting Partners, LLC loaned Optimus 1.3&nbsp;million shares of common stock. This tranche closed on October&nbsp;13, 2009, and we received proceeds of approximately $3.0 million, less the fees due on the entire financing commitment of $800 thousand. On November&nbsp;5, 2009, we closed the second tranche of this financing, issuing 166 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, for a tranche amount of approximately $1.7&nbsp;million. In support of this tranche, R &amp; R Consulting Partners, LLC loaned Optimus approximately 1.4&nbsp;million shares of common stock. </P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:11.133px; text-indent:48px">On May 12, 2010, R &amp; R demanded the return of 2.7 million shares loaned to Optimus. &nbsp;Also on May 12, 2010, we sent Optimus a notice of our election to convert all of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock into 2,729,452 shares of our common stock. &nbsp;Optimus returned these shares to R &amp; R in repayment of the loan. The conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock was determined by a fixed conversion price that was determined at the time of the closings of the Preferred Stock which were approximately $3.07 and $1.60, respectively. We were required to issue make-whole shares to Optimus equal to 35% of the Series A Liquidation Value ($10,000 per share of Series A Preferred Stock) because the Preferred Stock was redeemed prior the first anniversary of the issuance date. &nbsp;On October 13, 2010, we filed a Certificate of Elimination with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware effecting the elimination of the Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of Series A Preferred Stock. &nbsp;No shares of the Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding. </P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:11.133px; text-indent:48px">On March 14, 2011, we entered into an Amended and Restated Convertible Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement, or the &#147;Amended Purchase Agreement,&#148; with Optimus.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Amended Purchase Agreement amends and restates the Purchase Agreement, and, among other things, specifically (i) replaces the Series A Preferred Stock issuable under the Purchase Agreement with a Series C Preferred Stock with substantially similar terms, and (ii) reduces the maximum amount of preferred stock issuable to Optimus under the Purchase Agreement from $10,000,000 to $8,700,000, of which $4,700,000 worth was already issued (in 2009) under the Purchase Agreement as described above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:11.133px; text-indent:48px">Under the terms of the Amended Purchase Agreement, from time to time and in our sole discretion, we could present Optimus with a notice to purchase shares of the Series C Preferred Stock, or the &#147;Notice.&#148; &nbsp;&nbsp;Optimus was obligated to purchase such Series C Preferred Stock on the twentieth trading day after any Notice date, subject to satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including (i)&nbsp;that the Company was listed for and trading on a trading market, (ii)&nbsp;the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the Amended Purchase Agreement were true and correct as if made on each tranche date, and (iii)&nbsp;that no such purchase would result in Optimus and its affiliates beneficially owning more than 9.99% of the Company&#146;s common stock. In the event the closing bid price of the Company&#146;s common stock during any one or more of the nineteen trading days following the delivery of a Notice fell below 75% of the closing bid price on the trading day prior to the Notice date and Optimus determines not to complete the tranche closing, then we could, at our option, proceed to issue some or all of the applicable shares, provided that the conversion price for the Preferred Stock that was issued would reset at the lowest closing bid price for such nine trading day period. &nbsp;</P>

On April 12, 2011 the tranche closed and we received the $1.4 million of proceeds, less $100,000 that was paid to Optimus to waive the requirement under the Amended Purchase Agreement that the conversion price of the Series C Preferred Stock issued in the tranche be reset at the lowest closing bid price for the 19 trading days following the the tranche notice date, which was March 14, 2011, due to the closing bid price of a share of our common stock falling below 75% during such 19 trading day period.</P>

As a result, we were eligible for the &#147;controlled company&#148; exemption under the Nasdaq rules because we had more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors held by an individual, and therefore, we were not required to maintain a majority of independent directors. However, in February, 2010, we ceased to be a &#147;controlled company&#148; because the percentage of stock Mr.&nbsp;Silverman had voting control over fell below 50.1% of our outstanding common stock, and on May 24, 2010, the voting agreement was terminated. </P>

<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">The audit committee monitors our accounting and financial reporting process to assist our Board of Directors. Management has primary responsibility for our financial statements, financial reporting processes and internal control over financial reporting. The independent auditors are responsible for performing an independent audit of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and evaluating the effectiveness of internal controls and issuing a report thereon. The audit committee&#146;s responsibility is to select the independent auditors and monitor and oversee our accounting and financial reporting processes, including our internal controls over financial reporting, and the audits of our financial statements. </P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">The audit committee regularly met and held discussions with management and the independent auditors. In the discussions related to our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2010, management represented to the audit committee that such consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S.&nbsp;generally accepted accounting principles. The audit committee reviewed and discussed with management and the independent auditors the audited consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2010. </P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">In fulfilling its responsibilities, the audit committee discussed with the independent auditors the matters that are required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No.&nbsp;61, as amended, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (&#147;PCAOB&#148;) in Rule&nbsp;3200T. In addition, the audit committee received from the independent auditors the written disclosures and letter required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent accountant&#146;s communications with the audit committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent accountant the independent accountant&#146;s independence. In connection with this discussion, the audit committee also considered whether the provision of services by the independent auditors not related to the audit of our financial statements for fiscal year 2010 is compatible with maintaining the independent auditors&#146; independence. The audit committee&#146;s policy is that all services rendered by our independent auditor are either specifically approved or are pre-approved and are monitored both as to spending level and work content to maintain the appropriate objectivity and independence of the independent auditor. The audit committee&#146;s policy provides that the audit committee has the ultimate authority to approve all audit engagement fees and terms and that the audit committee shall review, evaluate and approve the annual engagement proposal of the independent auditor. </P>

The Stock Incentive Plan also is designed so that stock option and certain restricted and other cash and stock awards granted pursuant to its terms would generally not be subject to the tax deduction limits of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Section&nbsp;162(m) prevents a publicly held corporation from claiming tax deductions for annual compensation in excess of $1,000,000 to certain of its senior executives. The executives subject to the limitations of Section&nbsp;162(m) include any individual who, as of the last day of the corporation&#146;s taxable year, is the corporation&#146;s chief executive officer or among the three highest compensated officers other than the chief executive officer. &nbsp;Compensation is exempt from this limitation if it is qualified &#147;performance-based compensation.&#148; </P>

<P style="margin:0px">&nbsp;</P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:32.667px">The purpose of this proposal is to request stockholder approval of the material terms of the Stock Incentive Plan to qualify incentive stock awards under the Stock Incentive Plan for favorable tax treatment and to achieve application of the qualified performance-based compensation exception to the Section&nbsp;162(m) deduction limitation and to comply with the stockholder approval requirements of NASDAQ Rule&nbsp;5635(c). Approval of this proposal will ensure that we are able to receive tax deductions for the full amount of performance-based compensation paid to officers and other employees in the form of stock options, certain restricted stock awards and other types of stock-based payments under the Stock Incentive Plan. One of the requirements for performance-based compensation is that the corporation&#146;s stockholders must approve the material terms of the performance-based compensation. The material terms that must be approved include (1)&nbsp;the employees eligible to receive the performance-based compensation, (2)&nbsp;the objectives under which the performance-based compensation will be determined, and (3)&nbsp;the maximum amount of performance-based compensation that could be paid to any executive in a fiscal year. </P>

<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">The purposes of the Stock Incentive Plan are to attract and retain the best available personnel for positions of substantial responsibility, to provide additional incentive to our employees and consultants and to promote the long-term success of its business and to link participants&#146; directly to stockholder interests through increased stock ownership. </P>

<P style="margin:0px"><I>Awards.</I> </P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">The Stock Incentive Plan provides for awards of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, performance units, performance shares, stock appreciation rights, cash awards and other stock based awards. The Board of Directors may adopt plans applicable to particular subsidiaries.

<P style="margin:0px"><I>Stock Subject to the Stock Incentive Plan.</I> </P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">Under the Stock Incentive Plan, the aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be subject to awards under the Stock Incentive Plan, subject to adjustment upon a change in capitalization, is 6 million shares, which is approximately 15% of the fully diluted shares outstanding. Such shares of common stock may be authorized, but unissued, or reacquired shares of common stock. Shares of common stock that were subject to Stock Incentive Plan awards that expire or become unexercisable without having been exercised in full shall become available for future awards under the Stock Incentive Plan. </P>

<P style="margin:0px"><I>Administration.</I> </P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">The Stock Incentive Plan may be administered by the Board of Directors or by one or more committees of the Board, or the Administrator. The Board of Directors may require that the Administrator be constituted to comply with Rule&nbsp;16b-3 of the Exchange Act, Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code, or both. Subject to the provisions of the Stock Incentive Plan, the Administrator has the power to determine the terms of each award granted, including the exercise price, the number of shares subject to the award and the exercisability thereof. In accordance with applicable law, the Board of Directors may, by a resolution adopted by the Board, authorize one or more of our officers to designate officers (other than the officer so authorized) and employees to be recipients of stock options and determine the number of stock options to be granted. Such a resolution of the Board of Directors must specify the total number and the terms, including exercise price, of the stock options that our officer or officers may grant. </P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px"><I>Eligibility.</I> </P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">The Stock Incentive Plan provides that the Administrator may grant awards to our affiliates&#146; employees and consultants, including non-employee directors. Currently, we and our affiliates have approximately 18&nbsp;employees and 5 non-employee directors who would be potentially eligible for awards under the Stock Incentive Plan. The Administrator may grant incentive stock options only to employees. A grantee who has received a grant of an award may, if he is otherwise eligible, receive additional award grants. The Administrator selects the grantees and determines the number of shares of common stock to be subject to each award. In making such determination, the Administrator shall take into account the duties and responsibilities of the employee or consultant, the value of his services, his potential contribution to our success, the anticipated number of years of future service and other relevant factors. The Administrator may not grant to any employee, in any fiscal year, stock options to purchase more than 2,000,000&nbsp;shares of common stock. </P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px"><I>Maximum Term and General Terms and Conditions of Awards.</I> </P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">The maximum term of any stock option granted under the Stock Incentive Plan generally may not exceed ten years. </P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">Each award granted under the Stock Incentive Plan is evidenced by a written agreement between the grantee and us and is subject to the following general terms and conditions: </P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">(a)&nbsp;<I>Termination of Employment.</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;If a grantee&#146;s continuous status as an employee or consultant terminates (other than upon the grantee&#146;s death, disability, Retirement, Termination for Cause, or Termination by Employer Not for Cause (each defined below)), the grantee may exercise his unexercised option or stock appreciation right, but only within such period of time as is determined by the Administrator (with such determination being made at the time of grant and not exceeding three months in the case of an incentive stock option) and only to the extent that the grantee was entitled to exercise it at the date of such termination (but in no event may the option or stock appreciation right be exercised later than the expiration of the term of such award as set forth in the award agreement). A grantee&#146;s restricted stock award shall be forfeited, to the extent it is forfeitable immediately before the date of such termination, or settled by delivery of the appropriate number of unrestricted shares, to the extent it is nonforfeitable. A grantee&#146;s performance shares or performance units with respect to which the performance period has not ended as of the date of such termination shall terminate. </P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">(b)&nbsp;<I>Disability.</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;If a grantee&#146;s continuous status as an employee or consultant terminates as a result of permanent and total disability (as defined in Section&nbsp;22(e)(3) of the Code), unless otherwise provided by the Award Agreement, such termination shall have no effect on the grantee&#146;s outstanding awards. The grantee&#146;s outstanding awards shall continue to vest and remain outstanding and exercisable until they expire in accordance with their terms. However, in the case of an incentive stock option, any option not exercised within 12&nbsp;months after the date of such termination will be treated as a nonqualified stock option. </P>

<P style="margin:0px; page-break-before:always"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">(c)&nbsp;<I>Death.</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;If a grantee&#146;s continuous status as an employee or consultant terminates as a result of the grantee&#146;s death, unless otherwise provided by the Award Agreement, such termination shall have no effect on the grantee&#146;s outstanding awards. The grantee&#146;s outstanding awards shall continue to vest and remain outstanding and exercisable until they expire in accordance with their terms. However, in the case of an incentive stock option, any option not exercised within 12&nbsp;months after the date of such termination will be treated as a nonqualified stock option. </P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">(d)&nbsp;<I>Termination for Cause.</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;If a grantee&#146;s continuous status as an employee or consultant is terminated for Cause, or grantee violates any of the terms of their employment after they have become vested in any of their rights under the Stock Incentive Plan, the grantee&#146;s full interest in such rights shall terminate on the date of such termination of employment and all rights thereunder shall cease. Cause shall mean gross negligence, willful misconduct, flagrant or repeated violations of our policies, rules or ethics, a material breach by the grantee of any employment agreement between the grantee and us, intoxication, substance abuse, sexual or other unlawful harassment, disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, engaging in a business competitive with our business, or dishonest, illegal or immoral conduct. </P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">(e)&nbsp;<I>Termination by Employer Not for Cause.</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;If a grantee&#146;s continuous status as an employee or consultant is terminated by the employer without Cause (Termination by Employer Not for Cause), then, unless otherwise provided by the Award Agreement, such termination shall have no effect on grantee&#146;s outstanding awards. Grantee&#146;s awards shall continue to vest and remain outstanding and exercisable until they expire by their terms. In the case of an incentive stock option, any option not exercised within 3&nbsp;months of the date of termination of employment due to Termination by Employer Not For Cause will be treated as a nonqualified stock option. In the case of a grantee who is a director, the grantee&#146;s service as a director shall be deemed to have been terminated without Cause if the grantee ceases to serve in such a position solely due to the failure to be reelected or reappointed, as the case may be, and such failure is not a result of an act or omission which would constitute Cause. </P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">(f)&nbsp;<I>Retirement of Grantee.</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;If a grantee&#146;s continuous status as an employee or consultant terminates after the grantee&#146;s attainment of age&nbsp;65 (Retirement), then, unless otherwise provided by the Award Agreement, such termination shall have no effect on grantee&#146;s outstanding awards. The grantee&#146;s awards shall continue to vest and remain outstanding and exercisable until they expire by their terms. In the case of an incentive stock option, any option not exercised within 3&nbsp;months of the termination of grantee&#146;s continuous status as an employee or consultant due to Retirement will be treated as a nonqualified stock option. </P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">(g)&nbsp;<I>Nontransferability of Awards.</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, an award granted under the Stock Incentive Plan is not transferable by the grantee, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and is exercisable during the grantee&#146;s lifetime only by the grantee. In the event of the grantee&#146;s death, an option or stock appreciation right may be exercised by a person who acquires the right to exercise the award by bequest or inheritance. </P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px"><I>Terms and Conditions of Options.</I> </P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">Each option granted under the Stock Incentive Plan is subject to the following terms and conditions: </P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">(a)&nbsp;<I>Exercise Price.</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Administrator determines the exercise price of options to purchase shares of common stock at the time the options are granted. As a general rule, the exercise price of an option must be no less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date the option is granted. The Stock Incentive Plan provides exceptions for certain options granted in connection with our acquisition of another corporation or granted as inducements to an individual&#146;s commencing employment with us.</P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">(b)&nbsp;<I>Exercise of the Option.</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;Each award agreement specifies the term of the option and the date when the option is to become exercisable. The terms of such vesting are determined by the Administrator. An option is exercised by giving written notice of exercise to us, specifying the number of full shares of common stock to be purchased and by tendering full payment of the purchase price to us.</P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">(c)&nbsp;<I>Form of Consideration.</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;The consideration to be paid for the shares of common stock issued upon exercise of an option is determined by the Administrator and set forth in the award agreement. Such form of consideration may vary for each option, and may consist of any combination of cash, cashless exercise, and as permitted by the Administrator, promissory note, other shares of our common stock, or any other legally permissible form of consideration as may be provided in the Stock Incentive Plan and the Award Agreement. </P>

<P style="margin:0px; page-break-before:always"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">(d)&nbsp;<I>Value Limitation.</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;If the aggregate fair market value of all shares of common stock subject to a grantee&#146;s incentive stock option which are exercisable for the first time during any calendar year exceeds $100,000, the excess options shall be treated as nonqualified options. </P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">(e)&nbsp;<I>Other Provisions.</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;The award agreement may contain such other terms, provisions and conditions not inconsistent with the Stock Incentive Plan as may be determined by the Administrator. Shares of common stock covered by options which have terminated and which were not exercised prior to termination will be returned to the Stock Incentive Plan. </P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px"><I>Stock Appreciation Rights.</I> </P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">The Administrator may grant stock appreciation rights in tandem with an option or alone and unrelated to an option. Tandem stock appreciation rights shall expire no later than the expiration of the related option. Stock appreciation rights may be exercised by the delivery to us of a written notice of exercise. The exercise of a stock appreciation right will entitle the grantee to receive the excess of the fair market value of a share of common stock on the exercise date over the exercise price for each share of common stock with respect to which the stock appreciation right is exercised. Payment upon exercise of a stock appreciation right will be in shares of common stock. No employee shall be granted, in any fiscal year, stock appreciation rights with respect to more than 2,000,000&nbsp;shares of common stock. </P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px"><I>Restricted Stock Awards.</I> </P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">The Administrator may grant awards of restricted shares of common stock in such amount and upon such terms and conditions as the Administrator specifies in the award agreement. The Administrator may or may not grant awards of performance-based restricted stock. Only the compensation committee of the Board of Directors may serve as the Administrator with respect to awards of performance-based restricted stock. </P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px"><I>Restricted Stock Other Than Performance-Based Restricted Stock.</I> </P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">Restricted stock other than performance-based restricted stock may be granted to employees and consultants and may be subject to one or more contractual restrictions applicable generally or to a grantee in particular, as established at the time of grant and as set forth in the related restricted stock agreement. The restricted stock agreement sets forth the conditions, if any, which will need to be satisfied before the grant will be effective and the conditions, if any, under which the grantee&#146;s interest in the restricted shares will be forfeited. As soon as practicable after a grant has become effective, the shares will be registered to or for the benefit of the grantee, but subject to any forfeiture conditions established by the Administrator. The restricted stock agreement states whether the grantee has the right to receive any cash dividends paid with respect to the restricted shares. If the grantee has no right to receive cash dividends, the Award Agreement may give the grantee the right to receive a cash payment in the future in lieu of the dividend payments, provided certain conditions are met. Common share dividends declared on the restricted shares after grant but before the shares are forfeited or become nonforfeitable are treated as part of the grant of the related restricted shares. A grantee has the right to vote the restricted shares after grant until they are forfeited or become nonforfeitable. </P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">Restricted shares may vest in installments or in lump sum amounts upon satisfaction of the stipulated conditions. If the restrictions are not satisfied, the shares are forfeited and again become available under the Stock Incentive Plan. </P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">In the case of restricted stock grants that vest only on the satisfaction of performance objectives, the Administrator determines the performance objectives to be used in connection with restricted stock awards and the extent to which such objectives have been met. Performance objectives may vary from participant to participant and between groups of participants and shall be based upon such performance factors and criteria as the Administrator in its sole discretion selects. </P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px"><I>Performance-Based Restricted Stock.</I> </P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">The Administrator may make grants of performance-based restricted stock to employees and consultants. The Administrator has absolute discretion to establish the performance criteria that will be applicable to each grant and to determine the percentage of shares that will be granted upon various levels of attainment of the performance criteria. To comply with Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code, the establishment of the performance criteria and the determination of the grant formula must be made at the time of grant, but in no event later than 90&nbsp;days after the commencement of the performance measurement period. The Administrator can select the performance criteria that will be applicable to a grant of performance-based restricted shares from the following list: (1)&nbsp;stock price; (2)&nbsp;average annual growth in earnings per share; (3)&nbsp;increase in stockholder value; (4)&nbsp;earnings per share; (5)&nbsp;net income; (6)&nbsp;return on assets; (7)&nbsp;return on stockholders&#146; equity; (8)&nbsp;increase in cash flow; (9)&nbsp;operating profit or operating margins; (10)&nbsp;our revenue growth; or (11)&nbsp;operating expenses. </P>

<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">The related performance-based restricted stock agreement sets forth the applicable performance criteria and the deadline for satisfying the performance criteria. No grant of performance-based restricted shares is effective until the Administrator certifies that the applicable conditions (including performance criteria) have been timely satisfied. </P>
<P style="margin:0px">&nbsp;</P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">The Administrator may also make grants of performance-based restricted stock subject to one or more objective employment, performance or other forfeiture conditions applicable generally or to a grantee in particular, as established by the Administrator at the time of grant and as set forth in the related performance-based restricted stock agreement. The performance-based restricted stock agreement sets forth the conditions, if any, under which the grantee&#146;s interest in the performance-based restricted shares will be forfeited. If the grant or forfeiture conditions with respect to performance-based restricted shares are not satisfied, the shares are forfeited and again become available under the Stock Incentive Plan. </P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">As soon as practicable after a grant has become effective, the shares are registered to or for the benefit of the grantee, but subject to any forfeiture conditions established by the Administrator. The performance-based restricted stock agreement states whether the grantee has the right to receive any cash dividends paid with respect to the performance-based restricted shares. If the grantee has no right to receive cash dividends, the agreement may give the grantee the right to receive a cash payment in the future in lieu of the dividend payments, provided certain conditions are met. Common share dividends declared on the performance-based restricted shares after grant but before the shares are forfeited or become nonforfeitable are treated as part of the grant of the related restricted shares. A grantee has the right to vote the performance-based restricted shares after grant until they are forfeited or become nonforfeitable. </P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">No more than 2,000,000 performance-based restricted shares may be granted to a grantee in any calendar year. </P>

<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">The Administrator may grant awards of performance units and performance shares in such amounts and upon such terms and conditions, including the performance goals and the performance period, as the Administrator specifies in the award agreement. The Administrator will establish an initial value for each performance unit on the date of grant. </P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">The initial value of a performance share will be the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of grant. Payment of earned performance units or performance shares will occur following the close of the applicable performance period and in the form of cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. </P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px"><I>Cash Awards.</I> </P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>

Generally, a Change in Control means the acquisition by any person, of 50&nbsp;percent or more of our combined voting power then outstanding securities, the approval by our stockholders of a merger or consolidation of us, the effective date of a complete liquidation of us, or consummation of an agreement for the sale of substantially all of our assets. &nbsp;In the event of a Change in Control, in addition to the above, the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may take any of the following actions, in its sole discretion: (a)&nbsp;provide for the purchase of any award for an amount of cash equal to the amount which could have been attained upon the exercise or realization of such award; (b)&nbsp;make such adjustment to the awards then outstanding as the Administrator deems appropriate to reflect such transaction or change; and/or (c)&nbsp;provide that each outstanding award shall be assumed or substituted by any successor corporation. </P>

The general rule is that annual compensation paid to any of these specified executives will be deductible only to the extent that it does not exceed $1,000,000.

<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px"><B>Summary </B></P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px; text-indent:48px">Our Board of Directors has unanimously adopted a resolution approving, declaring advisable and recommending to the stockholders for their approval a proposal to authorize the Board to amend our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, which we will refer to as the Certificate of Incorporation, to effect a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock at a ratio in the range of 1-for-2 to 1-for-8. Approval of this Proposal&nbsp;No. 4 will grant the Board of Directors the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to carry out such action any time prior to our Annual Meeting of Stockholders in 2012, with the exact exchange ratio and timing to be determined at the discretion of the Board of Directors. The exchange ratio range of 1-for-2 to 1-for-8 is based on the trading price of our common stock over the last six months.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px; text-indent:48px">As discussed in greater detail below, the Board intends to amend our Certificate of Incorporation to effect the reverse stock split only if it is necessary for the Company&#146;s common stock to regain compliance with the $1.00 per share minimum bid price requirement, one of the continued listing requirements of the NASDAQ Capital Market, on which our common stock is currently listed, and only upon a determination by the Board that such action is our and our stockholders&#146; best interests. &nbsp;Such determination shall be based upon a number of factors, including:</P>

<P style="margin:0px; clear:left"><BR></P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px; text-indent:48px">A sample form of the certificate of amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation relating to this Proposal&nbsp;No. 4, which we would file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to effect the reverse stock split, is attached to this proxy statement as <B>Annex B</B>. </P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px; text-indent:48px">Except for adjustments that may result from the treatment of fractional shares resulting from the reverse stock split, as explained below under the caption &#147;Fractional Shares,&#148; each stockholder will hold the same percentage of our outstanding common stock immediately following the reverse stock split as such stockholder held immediately prior to the reverse stock split.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px"><B>Rationale for a Reverse Stock Split</B></P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px; text-indent:48px">Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Capital Market, which we believe helps support and maintain stock liquidity and company recognition for our stockholders. &nbsp;The primary reason our Board believes a reverse stock split may be desirable is to maintain the listing of our common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market. &nbsp;By potentially increasing our stock price through the reverse stock split, we would reduce the risk that our stock will be delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market, which requires, among other things, that listed companies maintain a closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px; text-indent:48px">Companies listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market are subject to various rules and requirements imposed by the NASDAQ Stock Market which must be satisfied in order to continue having their stock listed on the exchange. &nbsp;We have been out of compliance with NASDAQ&#146;s minimum bid price requirement since the fall of 2010. &nbsp;&nbsp;On September 13, 2010, we received a letter from the NASDAQ staff notifying us of our lack of compliance with this requirement and our being afforded a cure period of 180 calendar days to regain compliance. &nbsp;On March 15, 2011, we received a letter from the NASDAQ staff notifying us that we had not regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement during the 180-calendar day cure period and were not entitled to a second 180-calendar day cure period under applicable NASDAQ listing rules because, as of that date, we did not meet all of the standards for <I>initial</I> listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market other than the minimum bid price requirement. &nbsp;Accordingly, the NASDAQ staff advised us that our common stock was subject to delisting from the NASDAQ Capital Market unless we requested a hearing before a NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel, or the Panel. &nbsp;On March 31, 2011, the NASDAQ staff advised us that, in addition to our deficiency with respect to the minimum bid price requirement, our stockholders&#146; equity as of December 31, 2010 was below $2.5 million, another of the NASDAQ Capital Market&#146;s continued listing requirements.</P>

<P style="margin:0px; page-break-before:always"><BR></P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px; text-indent:48px">In an effort to maintain our listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market, we requested a hearing before a Panel, which was held on April 28, 2011. &nbsp;At the hearing, we advised the Panel members that as a result of equity financings completed in April 2011, we expected that our balance sheet for the quarterly period ending June 30, 2011, would reflect stockholders&#146; equity in excess of the $2.5 million listing requirement and we believed we would be able to maintain compliance with the stockholders&#146; equity requirement for the foreseeable future. &nbsp;We requested that the Panel grant us an exception with respect to the stockholders&#146; equity requirement through the earlier of the date we file our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ending June 30, 2011, or the date we file a Form 8-K (or Form 8-K amendment) that includes pro forma financial statements in connection with the closing of our acquisition of MicroFluidic Systems, at which time we expect &nbsp;that such financial statements will evidence that we have regained compliance with the stockholders&#146; equity requirement.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px; text-indent:48px">With respect to the minimum bid price deficiency, we requested that the Panel grant us an exception from the listing requirement, of up to 180-calendar days from the date of the NASDAQ staff&#146;s March 15, 2011 delisting determination letter (the maximum period within the Panel&#146;s discretion under applicable NASDAQ listing rules), to enable us to regain compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price. &nbsp;In connection with this request, we advised the Panel that we intended to seek stockholder approval of an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split for this purpose, such proposal to be included in our proxy statement for our 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. &nbsp;</P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">The Panel provided us with an exception period to regain compliance with the continued listing requirements, as follows: </P>

<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:-2px; text-indent:72px; width:96px; font-family:Symbol; clear:left; float:left">&#183;</P>
<P style="margin:0px; padding-left:96px; text-indent:-2px"><I>Stockholders&#146; Equity Requirement</I>. &nbsp;On or before August 15, 2011, we must file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (i) a current report on Form 8-K with <I>pro forma</I> financial statements giving effect to the our acquisition of MicroFluidic Systems (a transaction which closed on May 23, 2011), and (ii) our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2011, including interim financial statements, which reflect that we have stockholders&#146; equity in excess of $2.5 million.</P>
<P style="margin:0px; clear:left"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">In addition, the Panel, in its discretion, determined to appoint a Hearings Panel Monitor to monitor our maintenance of compliance with the stockholders&#146; equity requirement through May 31, 2012. &nbsp;During this period, we will be obligated to notify the Panel in the event that our stockholders&#146; equity falls below $2.5 million or if we cease to comply with any other applicable continued listing requirement. &nbsp;Should we not regain, and maintain during the monitor period, compliance with the continued listing requirements of the NASDAQ Capital Market, we may not be afforded the additional time provided by applicable Nasdaq Listing Rules and, as such, may be subject to delisting on a more expedited basis than would otherwise be the case.</P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px; text-indent:48px">A reverse stock split by a publicly traded company reduces the number of shares outstanding, but leaves the market capitalization of the company the same, which results in an increase in the price per share of the company&#146;s stock. Put another way, after a reverse stock split, the enterprise value of the company is spread over fewer shares and so the per share price of the stock will be higher. As an example, a hypothetical company with 100 million shares outstanding and a market capitalization of &nbsp;$50&nbsp;million (or $.50 per share) would, following its effecting a 1-for-4 reverse stock split, have 25 million shares outstanding and, assuming no change in its market capitalization of $50 million, a post-reverse split share price of $2.00 ($50 million divided by 25 million shares). </P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">We are asking stockholders to approve this Proposal&nbsp;because we believe a reverse stock split will result in a higher price per share for outstanding shares of our common stock. This, we believe, could provide a number of potential advantages. We describe each of these below. </P>

We believe that having our common stock delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market would be undesirable for our stockholders and potentially bad for our business. Among other things, being delisted could reduce the liquidity of our common stock. We also deem valuable our ticker symbol, which is easily recognized as &#147;PSID&#148; and which we could lose if we were delisted by the NASDAQ Capital Market. Also, being listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market carries with it certain prestige and we feel it improves the recognition of our Company. </P>

While our stock price could trade above $1.00 on its own accord over the next few months, our Board believes that it is in our best interests and in the interests of our stockholders to seek authorization of the Board, in its discretion, to amend our Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split so that we can regain compliance even if our stock trading price does not increase above $1.00 per share by September 12, 2011, the end of our compliance period.</P>


<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px; text-indent:48px"><I>Potential Advantage&nbsp;#2&nbsp;&#151; Facilitate Potential Future Financings</I>.&nbsp;&nbsp;By preserving our NASDAQ Capital Market listing, we can continue to consider and pursue a wide range of future financing options to support our business. We believe being listed on a national securities exchange, such as the NASDAQ Capital Market, is valued highly by many long-term investors such as large institutions. A listing on a national securities exchange also has the potential to create better liquidity and reduce volatility for buying and selling shares of our stock, which benefits our current and future stockholders.</P>



<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px; text-indent:48px"><I>Potential Advantage&nbsp;#3&nbsp;&#151; Increase Our Common Stock Price to a Level&nbsp;More Appealing for Investors</I>.&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that the reverse stock split could enhance the appeal of our common stock to the financial community, including institutional investors, and the general investing public. We believe that a number of institutional investors and investment funds are reluctant to invest in lower priced securities and that brokerage firms may be reluctant to recommend lower priced stock to their clients, which may be due in part to a perception that lower-priced securities are less promising as investments, are less liquid in the event that an investor wishes to sell his, her or its shares, or are less likely to be followed by institutional securities research firms. We believe that the reduction in the number of issued and outstanding shares of our common stock caused by the reverse stock split, together with the anticipated increased stock price immediately following and resulting from the reverse stock split, may encourage further interest and trading in our common stock and thus possibly promote greater liquidity for our stockholders, thereby resulting in a broader market for our common stock than that which currently exists. </P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:11.133px">&nbsp;<FONT style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:10pt"><B>Certain Risks Associated with the Reverse Stock Split </B></P>
<P style="line-height:12pt; margin:0px; text-indent:48px"><B><I>The proposed reverse stock split may not ultimately increase our stock price, which would prevent us from realizing some of the anticipated benefits of the reverse stock split, including maintaining our listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market.</I></B></P>
<P style="line-height:12pt; margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="line-height:12pt; margin:0px; text-indent:48px">The Board expects that a reverse stock split of our common stock will increase the market price of our common stock so that we are able to regain compliance with the NASDAQ Capital Market minimum bid price listing standard. &nbsp;However, the effect of a reverse stock split upon the market price of our common stock cannot be predicted with any certainty, and the history of similar stock splits for companies in like circumstances is varied. &nbsp;It is possible that the per share price of our common stock immediately after the reverse stock split will not rise in proportion to the reduction in the number of shares of our common stock outstanding resulting from the reverse stock split.</P>
<P style="line-height:12pt; margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="line-height:12pt; margin:0px; text-indent:48px">Further, there can be no assurance that the market price of our post-reverse split shares will either exceed or remain in excess of the $1.00 minimum bid price for a sustained period of time. &nbsp;It is not uncommon for the share price of a company that has effected a reverse stock split to decline in the months following the split. If we effect a reverse stock split and the market price of our common stock declines, the percentage decline may be greater than would occur in the absence of a reverse stock split. &nbsp;In any event, other factors unrelated to the number of shares of our common stock outstanding, such as our future operating results, will influence the market price of our stock.</P>
<P style="line-height:12pt; margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="line-height:12pt; margin:0px; text-indent:48px">In addition, there can be no assurance that our stock will not be delisted due to a failure in the future to meet other continued listing requirements, including the minimum stockholders&#146; equity requirement, even if the market price per post-reverse stock split share of our common stock regains and remains in compliance with the $1.00 per share requirement.</P>
<P style="line-height:12pt; margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px; text-indent:48px"><B><I>A reverse stock split may not increase our stock price over the long-term, which may prevent us from continuing to qualify for listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market. </I></B></P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px; text-indent:48px">While we expect that a reverse stock split, together with the other actions we advised the Panel of at the hearing, will enable us to regain compliance with all of the applicable continued listing standards of The NASDAQ Capital Market and that we will be able to continue to meet NASDAQ&#146;s on-going quantitative and qualitative listing requirements for the foreseeable future, we cannot be sure that this will be the case. &nbsp;Negative financial or operational results or adverse market conditions could affect the market price of our common stock and jeopardize our ability to meet or maintain applicable NASDAQ continued listing requirements. &nbsp;Furthermore, in addition to its enumerated listing and maintenance standards, NASDAQ has broad discretionary authority over the initial and continued listing of securities, which it could exercise with respect to our common stock.</P>

<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px; text-indent:48px">The liquidity of our capital stock may be harmed by the proposed reverse split given the reduced number of shares that will be outstanding after the reverse stock split, particularly if the stock price does not increase as a result of the reverse stock split. &nbsp;In addition, the proposed reverse stock split may increase the number of stockholders who own odd lots (less than 100 shares) of our common stock, creating the potential for such stockholders to experience an increase in the cost of selling their shares and greater difficulty effecting sales.</P>

<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">While our Board of Directors believes that a higher stock price may help generate greater/broader investor interest, there can be no assurance that a reverse stock split will result in a per-share price that will attract institutional investors or investment funds or that such share price will satisfy the investing guidelines of institutional investors or investment funds. As a result, the trading liquidity of our common stock may not necessarily improve.</P>

<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px"><I>Reduction of Shares Held by Our Stockholders.</I></P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px; text-indent:48px">After the effective date of the proposed reverse stock split, each stockholder will own fewer shares of our common stock. &nbsp;However, the proposed reverse stock split will affect all of our stockholders uniformly and will not affect any stockholder&#146;s percentage ownership interest in us, except to the extent that the reverse split results in any of our stockholders owning a fractional share, as described below. &nbsp;For example, a holder of two percent of the voting power of the outstanding shares of common stock immediately prior to the reverse stock split would continue to hold two percent of the voting power of the outstanding shares of common stock immediately after the reverse stock split.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px; text-indent:48px">The number of stockholders of record will not be affected by the proposed reverse stock split, except to the extent that any stockholder holds only a fractional share interest after the reverse stock split is effected and receives cash for such interest.</P>
<P style="margin:0px"><I>Change in Number and Exercise Price of Outstanding Options and Warrants; Change in Number of Shares of Common Stock Underlying, and Conversion Price of, Outstanding Convertible Stock. </I></P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">The proposed reverse stock split will reduce the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under our equity plans in proportion to the exchange ratio selected by the Board.</P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">&nbsp;Under the terms of our outstanding equity awards and warrants, the proposed reverse stock split will cause a reduction in the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise or vesting of such awards and warrants in proportion to the exchange ratio of the reverse stock split and will cause a proportionate increase in the exercise price of such awards and warrants. &nbsp;The number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise or vesting of outstanding equity awards and warrants will be rounded to the nearest whole share and no cash payment will be made in respect of such rounding.</P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">In addition, the proposed reverse stock split will cause a reduction in the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of shares of our convertible preferred stock in proportion to the exchange ratio of the reverse stock split and will cause a proportionate increase in the conversion price of such shares of preferred stock.</P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P style="margin:0px"><I>Reduction in Number of Outstanding Shares; Increase in Number of Unreserved Shares</I>.</P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">&nbsp;If the proposed reverse stock split is effected, it will automatically apply to all shares of our common stock, including the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants and the conversion of convertible preferred stock. &nbsp;The proposed reverse stock split will reduce the total number of outstanding shares of common stock by the split ratio determined by our Board. &nbsp;The following table contains approximate information relating to our common stock under certain of the possible split ratios, based on share information as of July 8, 2011:</P>

<P style="margin:0px; padding-left:27px; text-indent:-27px">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A narrative description of the material terms of our equity compensation plans is set forth in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010.</P>
<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px">As reflected in the table above, the number of authorized shares of our common stock will not be reduced by the reverse stock split. &nbsp;Accordingly, the reverse stock split will have the effect of creating additional unissued and unreserved shares of our common stock. &nbsp;At present, we have no current arrangements or understandings providing for the issuance of any of the additional authorized and unreserved shares of our common stock that would be available as a result of the proposed reverse stock split. &nbsp;However, these additional shares may be used by us for various purposes in the future without further stockholder approval (subject to applicable NASDAQ listing standards), including, among other things: (i) raising capital necessary to fund our future operations; (ii) providing equity incentives to our employees, officers, directors and consultants; (iii) entering into collaborations and other strategic relationships; and (iv) expanding our business through the acquisition of other businesses or products.</P>

<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px; text-indent:48px">Our common stock is currently registered under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. &nbsp;We are subject to the periodic reporting and other requirements of the Exchange Act. &nbsp;Filing an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split will not affect the registration of our common stock under the Exchange Act or our obligation to publicly file financial and other information with the SEC. &nbsp;If the proposed reverse stock split is implemented, we would expect our common stock to continue to trade on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol &#147;PSID&#148; (although NASDAQ would likely add the letter &#147;D&#148; to the end of the trading symbol for a period of 20 trading days to indicate that the reverse stock split has occurred).</P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px"><B>Board Discretion to Implement the Reverse Stock Split </B></P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px; text-indent:48px">Should we receive the required stockholder approval of Proposal 4 at the 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our Board of Directors will have the authority to file the amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and thereby implement the reverse stock split. &nbsp;The Board will have the authority to take such action at any time prior to our 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. &nbsp;The Board intends to take such action only if it is necessary for the Company&#146;s common stock to regain compliance with the $1.00 per share minimum bid price requirement, and only upon a determination by the Board that such action is our and our stockholders&#146; best interests. &nbsp;Such determination shall be based upon a number of factors, including:</P>

<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px; text-indent:48px">Notwithstanding receipt of the required stockholder approval of Proposal 4 at the 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, abandon the proposed amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation and determine not to effect the reverse stock split, as permitted under Section 242(c) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. &nbsp;If the Board determines not to implement the reverse stock split prior to the 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, we would be required, once again, to seek stockholder approval to implement a reverse stock split.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px"><B>Effective Date </B></P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px; text-indent:48px">The proposed reverse stock split would become effective on the date of filing of the proposed amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation (in the form attached to this proxy statement as <B>Annex B</B>) with the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. &nbsp;Except as explained below with respect to fractional shares, on the effective date, shares of common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective date will be combined and converted, automatically and without any action on the part of the stockholders, into new shares of common stock in accordance with the reverse stock split ratio determined by the Board, which ratio shall be within the limits set forth in this Proposal &nbsp;4.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px"><B>Fractional Shares </B></P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px; text-indent:48px">Stockholders will not receive fractional shares in connection with the proposed reverse stock split. Instead, we will pay to each registered stockholder, in cash, the value of any fractional share interest in our common stock arising from the reverse stock split. Those registered stockholders who hold their shares of our common stock in certificated form will receive a cash payment for their fractional interest, if applicable, following the surrender of their pre-reverse stock split stock certificates for post-reverse stock split shares. The amount of the cash payment will equal the product obtained by multiplying (a) the number of shares of common stock held by such stockholder that would otherwise have been exchanged for such fractional share interest, by (b) the volume weighted average price of our common stock as reported on The NASDAQ Capital Market, or other principal market of our common stock, as applicable, on the effective date of the reverse stock split. This cash payment may be subject to applicable U.S.&nbsp;federal, state and local income taxes. &nbsp;We do not anticipate that the aggregate cash amount paid for fractional shares will be material to us.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px; text-indent:48px">&nbsp;No transaction costs will be assessed on stockholders for the cash payment. Stockholders will not be entitled to receive interest for the period of time between the effective date of the reverse stock split and the date payment is made for their fractional share interest in our common stock. You should also be aware that, under the escheat laws of certain jurisdictions, sums due for fractional share interests that are not timely claimed after the funds are made available may be required to be paid to the designated agent for each such jurisdiction. Thereafter, stockholders otherwise entitled to receive such funds may have to obtain the funds directly from the state to which they were paid. </P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px"><B>Procedures for Exchange of Pre-Reverse Stock Split Shares with Post-Reverse Stock Split Shares </B></P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px; text-indent:48px">If we implement the proposed reverse stock split, our transfer agent will act as our exchange agent to act for holders of common stock in implementing the exchange of their pre-reverse stock split shares for post-reverse stock split shares. </P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px; text-indent:48px"><I>Registered Certificated Stockholders</I>. Some of our registered stockholders hold all their shares in certificated form. If any of your shares are held in certificated form, you will receive a transmittal letter from our transfer agent, Registrar and Transfer Company, as soon as practicable after the effective date of the reverse stock split. The letter of transmittal will contain instructions on how to surrender your certificate(s) representing your pre-reverse stock split shares to the transfer agent.</P>
<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px"><I>Registered and Beneficial Stockholders</I>. &nbsp;We intend to treat stockholders holding common stock in &#147;street name,&#148; through a bank, broker or other nominee, in the same manner as registered stockholders whose shares are registered in their names. Banks, brokers or other nominees will be instructed to effect the reverse stock split for their beneficial holders holding common stock in &#147;street name.&#148; However, these banks, brokers or other nominees may have different procedures than registered stockholders for processing the reverse stock split. If you hold your shares with a bank, broker or other nominee and if you have any questions in this regard, we encourage you to contact your bank, broker or nominee. </P>

<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px; text-indent:48px">The par value per share of our common stock will remain unchanged at $0.01 per share after the reverse stock split. &nbsp;As a result, on the effective date of the proposed reverse stock split, the stated capital on our consolidated balance sheet attributable to common stock will be reduced proportionately and the additional paid-in-capital account will be increased by the amount by which the stated capital is reduced. &nbsp;In future financial statements, we would restate per share net income or loss and other per share amounts for periods ending before the reverse stock split to give retroactive effect to the reverse stock split. Per share net income or loss will be increased because there will be fewer shares of our common stock outstanding. &nbsp;We do not anticipate that any other accounting consequences, including changes to the amount of stock-based compensation expense to be recognized in any period, will arise as a result of the reverse stock split. </P><P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px"><B>No Going Private Transaction </B></P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px; text-indent:48px">Notwithstanding the decrease in the number of outstanding shares following implementation of the proposed reverse stock split, the Board of Directors does not intend for this transaction to be the first step in a &#147;going private transaction&#148; within the meaning of Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act. </P><P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px"><B>Potential Anti-Takeover Effect </B></P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px; text-indent:32.667px">Although the increased proportion of unissued authorized shares to issued shares could, under certain circumstances, have an anti-takeover effect (for example, by permitting issuances that would dilute the stock ownership of a person seeking to effect a change in the composition of our Board of Directors or contemplating a tender offer or other transaction for the combination of us and another company), the proposed reverse stock split is not being proposed in response to any effort of which we are aware to accumulate shares of our common stock or obtain control of us, nor is it part of a plan by management to recommend a series of similar actions to the Board of Directors and stockholders. Other than seeking authorization for the Board to amend our Certificate of Incorporation to effect the reverse stock split, the Board of Directors does not currently contemplate recommending the adoption of any other actions that could be construed to affect the ability of third parties to take over or change control of our company. </P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px"><B>No Appraisal Rights </B></P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px; text-indent:48px">Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, our stockholders are not entitled to appraisal rights with respect to the proposed amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to effect the reverse stock split, and we will not independently provide stockholders with any such right. &nbsp;</P><P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px"><B>Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences </B></P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px; text-indent:48px">The following is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the proposed reverse stock split. This discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code, the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, published statements by the Internal Revenue Service and other applicable authorities on the date of this proxy statement, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion does not address the tax consequences to holders of shares or our common stock that are subject to special tax rules, such as banks, insurance companies, regulated investment companies, personal holding companies, foreign entities, nonresident alien individuals, broker-dealers and tax-exempt entities. &nbsp;Further, it does not address any state, local or foreign income or other tax consequences. This summary also assumes that the shares of common stock held immediately prior to the effective time of the reverse stock split (the &#147;pre-reverse split shares&#148;) were, and the new shares received (the &#147;post-reverse split shares&#148;) will be, held as a &#147;capital asset,&#148; as defined in the Internal Revenue Code (generally, property held for investment). </P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px; text-indent:48px">We believe that the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the proposed reverse stock split would be as follows: &nbsp;</P>
<P style="line-height:12pt; margin-top:5.533px; margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:48px">The proposed reverse stock split is intended to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code. &nbsp;Assuming the reverse stock split qualifies as a reorganization, a stockholder generally will not recognize gain or loss on the reverse stock split, except to the extent of cash, if any, received in lieu of a fractional share interest in the post-reverse split shares. &nbsp;The aggregate tax basis of the post-reverse split shares received will be equal to the aggregate tax basis of the pre-reverse split shares exchanged therefor (excluding any portion of the holder&#146;s basis allocated to fractional shares), and the holding period of the post-reverse split shares received will include the holding period of the pre-reverse split shares exchanged.</P>

<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px; text-indent:48px">A holder of the pre-reverse split shares who receives cash generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the portion of the tax basis of the pre-reverse split shares allocated to the fractional share interest and the cash received. &nbsp;Such gain or loss will be a capital gain or loss and will be short term if the pre-reverse split shares were held for one year or less and long term if held more than one year.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px; text-indent:48px">No gain or loss will be recognized by us as a result of the proposed reverse stock split.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px; text-indent:48px">Our beliefs regarding the tax consequences of the proposed reverse stock split is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or the courts. <B>Accordingly, we urge you to consult with your own tax adviser with respect to all of the potential tax consequences to you of the reverse stock split.</B> </P>

However, if we change the date of our 2012 Annual Meeting by more than 30&nbsp;days from the date of our 2011 Annual Meeting, then the deadline is a reasonable time before we begin to print and send our proxy materials for the 2012 Annual Meeting. Proposals by stockholders to be presented at our 2012 Annual Meeting (but not intended to be included in our 2012 Proxy Statement) must be submitted in writing to our Secretary no earlier than April 28, 2012, but no later than May 28, 2012, in accordance with our bylaws; however, in the event that 2012 Annual Meeting is called for a date that is not within 45&nbsp;days before or after the anniversary date of our 2011 Annual Meeting, to be timely, the stockholder&#146;s notice must be received not earlier than the opening of business on the 120th day before the 2012 Annual Meeting and not later than the later of (x)&nbsp;the close of business on the 90th day before the 2012 Annual Meeting or (y)&nbsp;the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the 2012 Annual Meeting is made.

This practice is known as &#147;householding.&#148; Stockholders who hold their shares through a bank, broker or other nominee may have consented to reducing the number of copies of materials delivered to their address. In the event that a stockholder wishes to request delivery of a single copy of annual reports or proxy statements or to revoke a &#147;householding&#148; consent previously provided to a bank, broker or other nominee, the stockholder must contact the bank, broker or other nominee, as applicable, to revoke such consent.
