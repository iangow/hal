                 INFORMATION CONCERNING SOLICITATION AND VOTING

REVOCABILITY OF PROXIES

     Any stockholder who executes and returns a proxy card may revoke the same
at any time before it is exercised by filing with the Secretary of the Company
written notice of such revocation or a duly executed proxy card bearing a later
date, or by attending the Special Meeting and voting in person. Attendance at
the Special Meeting will not in and of itself constitute revocation of a proxy.

RECORD DATE

     Stockholders of record at the close of business on July 2, 2004 (the
"Record Date") are entitled to notice of and to vote at the Special Meeting. On
June 21, 2004, 4,445,369 shares of the Company's common stock were issued and
outstanding.

VOTING AND SOLICITATION

     Holders of the Company's common stock of record as of the close of business
on the Record Date are entitled to one vote per share of common stock. The
Company's Certificate of Incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting
rights.

     A plurality of the votes cast at the Special Meeting is required to elect
directors. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of
the Company's common stock present (either in person or by proxy) and entitled
to vote at the Special Meeting is required to approve the amendment to the
Company's Certificate of Incorporation. The affirmative vote of a majority of
the total votes cast on the proposal is required to ratify the selection of
McGladrey &amp; Pullen, LLP as the Company's independent auditors for 2004, and to
approve the sale of the preferred stock and warrants. In accordance with
Delaware law and the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, (1) for
the election of directors, which requires a plurality of the votes cast, only
proxies and ballots indicating votes "FOR" or "WITHHELD" are counted to
determine the total number of votes cast, and broker non-votes are not counted;
(2) for the approval of the sale of the preferred stock and warrants and the
ratification of the selection of accountants, only proxies and ballots
indicating votes "FOR" or "AGAINST" are counted to determine the total number of
votes cast, and broker non-votes are not counted; and (3) for the adoption of
all other proposals, which are decided by a majority of the shares of the stock
of the Company present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote, only proxies
and ballots indicating votes "FOR," "AGAINST," or "ABSTAIN" on the proposal or
providing the designated proxies with the right to vote in their judgment and
discretion on the proposal are counted to determine the number of shares present
and entitled to vote, and broker non-votes are not counted.

     The cost of soliciting proxies will be borne by the Company. In addition,
the Company may reimburse brokerage firms and other persons representing
beneficial owners of shares for their expenses in forwarding solicitation
material to such beneficial owners. Proxies may also be solicited by certain of
the Company's directors, officers and regular employees, without additional
compensation, personally or by telephone or telecopier.

   SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

     Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act")
requires the Company's officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10%
of the Company's outstanding common stock, to file reports of ownership and
changes in ownership of such securities with the SEC. Officers, directors and
greater-than-10% beneficial owners are required to furnish the Company with
copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely upon a review of the
copies of the forms furnished to the Company, and/or written representations
from certain reporting persons that no other reports were required, the Company
believes that all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to its officers,
directors and 10% owners during or with respect to the year ended December 31,
2003 were met.

1. ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

     The Board of Directors is divided into three classes, each of whose members
serve for a staggered three-year term. The Board is comprised of one Class I
Director (Gregory E. Meyer), one Class II Director (Joseph A. Turek) and two
Class III Directors (Lavern D. Kramer and Gary L. Castagna).

     The Board of Directors has nominated Lavern D. Kramer and Gary L. Castagna
to stand for reelection as Class III Directors for terms ending upon the
election of directors at the 2007 annual meeting of stockholders. There is a
vacancy in the Class II Directors and the Board of Directors has nominated Jim
Mayer for a term ending upon the election of directors at the 2006 annual
meeting of stockholders.

     The current Class I Director is not up for election this year and has a
term ending upon the election of directors at the 2005 annual meeting of
stockholders. The current Class II Director is not up for election this year and
has a term ending upon the election of directors at the 2006 annual meeting of
stockholders. At the Special Meeting, the shares of the Company's common stock
represented by proxies in the form accompanying this Proxy Statement, unless
otherwise specified, will be voted to reelect the nominees for Class III
Directors and to elect the nominee for Class II Director. The nominees have
agreed to serve if elected. However, if any nominees become unable or unwilling
to serve if elected, the proxies will be voted for the election of the
replacement nominees, if any, recommended by the Board of Directors or, in the
alternative, for holding a vacancy to be filled by the Board of Directors. The
Board of Directors has no reason to believe that any nominees will be unable or
unwilling to serve.

DIRECTOR CONTINUING IN OFFICE UNTIL 2005 ANNUAL MEETING


Class I Director

     GREGORY E. MEYER, 54, has been a director since December 2000. Mr. Meyer
held various positions at Chemdal Corporation, a subsidiary of Amcol
International Corporation, from 1986 to 2000, the most recent of which was
Executive Vice President of Chemdal International.

                   BOARD OF DIRECTORS MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES

     The Board of Directors of the Company held ten meetings during 2003. The
Board of Directors also has an Audit Committee and a Compensation Committee. The
Board of Directors does not have a Nominating Committee. The Audit Committee
held three meetings and the Compensation Committee held two meetings during
2003. The Committees receive their authority and assignments from the Board of
Directors and report

                                        6
  </page>
  <page>
   to the Board of Directors. No Director attended fewer than 75% of the aggregate
number of meetings of the Board of Directors and the Committees on which he
served during the period for which he was a Director.


     Messrs. Kramer, Meyer and Castagna are members of the Audit Committee. Mr.
Castagna qualifies as an audit committee financial expert, and he is
"independent" as defined in Rule 4200(a)(15) of the NASD's listing standards.
The Audit Committee recommends the engagement of the Company's independent
auditors and is primarily responsible for approving the services performed by
the Company's independent auditors. The Committee also reviews and evaluates the
Company's accounting principles and its system of internal accounting controls.
A more detailed description of the function of the Audit Committee may be found
in the Audit Committee Charter, which was included as Appendix A to the proxy
statement for our 2002 annual meeting. Please see the Audit Committee Report at
page 10 below.


     Messrs. Kramer, Meyer and Castagna are the members of the Compensation
Committee. The Compensation Committee reviews and approves the Company's
executive compensation policy, makes recommendations concerning the Company's
employee benefit policies, and has authority to administer the Plan.

     The Board of Directors has not established a Nominating Committee because
the full Board of Directors performs such duties. All Directors participate in
the consideration of director nominees. The Board of Directors will consider all
candidates for director that are recommended by stockholders. Recommendations
should be mailed to the Company's principal offices, 475 Industrial Drive, West
Chicago, IL 60185, attention: President, at least 120 days prior to the year's
annual meeting. Given the evolving restructuring of the Company's business, a
primary factor in the consideration of a candidate for director is knowledge of
the Company's restructuring, industry and business plan. The Board of Directors
gives no special positive or negative consideration to a candidate based on the
party that recommended the candidate. All nominees for election at the Special
Meeting were nominated by the full Board of Directors.

     Stockholders who wish to communicate directly with one or more directors
may do so by mailing such communications to the Company's principal offices 475
Industrial Drive, West Chicago, IL 60185, attention: President. The President
will then relay all communications to the appropriate director(s).

     The Company does not have a policy regarding the attendance of directors at
annual or special meetings of stockholders. All four directors continuing in
office attended the prior year's annual meeting.

                           COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS


     The Company's compensation policy for non-employee directors currently
compensates each director $500 per meeting of the Board or any Committee
attended. The Company also reimburses non-employee directors for their
reasonable expenses incurred in connection with attending Board or Committee
meetings. Each non-employee director receives (1) upon election to the Board,
options to purchase 10,000 shares of the Company's common stock at the fair
market value per share on the date of grant for five years after grant and (2)
an annual grant of options to purchase 2,000 shares of the Company's common
stock at the fair market value per share on the date of grant for five years
after grant. In addition, in lieu of deferred retainers, on January 1, 2004,
each non-employee director then in office received a one-time grant of options
to purchase 20,000 shares of the Company's common stock at the fair market value
per share on the date of grant for five years after grant.

   EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

     Each of Messrs. Turek and Schmitt entered into an employment agreement with
the Company, effective as of January 29, 2001, which provides for his continued
employment in his present capacity through January 29, 2003. Each of the
foregoing agreements continues thereafter indefinitely, unless terminated by
either party by giving notice at least six months prior to termination.

     The executives are entitled to the following annual salaries under the
employment agreements: Mr. Turek, $160,000; and Mr. Schmitt, $135,000. Each
executive is also entitled to an annual bonus of up to 60% of his base salary if
the Company achieves threshold performance goals established by the Compensation
Committee.

     Under the terms of the employment agreements, if the executive is
terminated without cause or resigns with good reason, he is entitled to receive
his annual salary for six months; provided, however, that if such termination
occurs on or after a sale of all of the stock of the Company or a sale of all or
substantially all of the Company's assets, the executive is entitled to receive
on the date of such termination a lump-sum payment equal to two times his annual
salary instead of the six-month salary referenced above.

     In connection with his employment agreement, the Company granted options to
Mr. Schmitt to purchase 40,000 shares of common stock with an exercise price
equal to $7.4375 per share. These options vest 40% on the second anniversary of
the grant and 20% each anniversary thereafter.

     In January 2003, Mr. Schmitt entered into a new employment agreement with
the Company, replacing the January 2001 agreement. The 2003 employment agreement
provides for continued employment in his present capacity for two years.

     Under the 2003 employment agreement, Mr. Schmitt is entitled to a $145,000
annual salary and an annual bonus in an amount to be determined by the Board of
Directors.

     Under the terms of the 2003 employment agreement, if Mr. Schmitt is
terminated without cause or resigns with good reason, he is entitled to receive
his annual salary for twelve months; provided, however, that if such termination
occurs on or after a sale of all of the stock of the Company or a sale of all or
substantially all of the Company's assets, Mr. Schmitt is entitled to receive on
the date of such termination a lump-sum payment equal to two times his annual
salary instead of the twelve-month salary referenced above. In connection with
the employment agreement, the Company agreed to grant to Mr. Schmitt options to
purchase 76,000 shares of common stock with an exercise price equal to $1.25 per
share.


     On May 1, 2004, Mr. Schmitt's 2003 employment agreement was terminated, as
Mr. Schmitt resigned as the Company's CFO and became employed as a Special
Consultant to the Company through January 29, 2005. Under a new agreement, Mr.
Schmitt is currently paid at an annual rate of $145,000, plus life, medical,
dental, and disability insurance benefits; and will work 15 consecutive business
days beginning May 3, 2004 and 25 additional full business days prior to August
31, 2004. To the extent the Company requests Mr. Schmitt to work in excess of
such 15 business days and 25 business days, the Company will pay Mr. Schmitt at
the rate of $70 per hour. Pursuant to the amendment, all unvested Company stock
options held by Mr. Schmitt were vested in full on May 1, 2004.



     On May 1, 2004, the Company entered into a new employment agreement with
Mr. Turek, which expires December 31, 2006. Under the agreement, the Company
agreed to pay Mr. Turek at an annual rate of $125,000 through August 31, 2004,
at an annual rate of $195,000 through April 30, 2005, and at an annual rate of
$215,000 thereafter. The Company also agreed to pay Mr. Turek, if the Company's
gross margin for the 2004 fiscal year exceeds $3,726,000, a bonus for the 2004
fiscal year equal to $15,000 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the Company's gross margin in such fiscal year and the denominator of which is
$3,726,000. Bonuses in subsequent years will be made at the discretion of the
Company's Board of Directors. If Mr. Turek's employment is terminated by either
Mr. Turek or the Company within certain periods following a "change of control"
of the Company, Mr. Turek is entitled to a lump-sum payment equal to 150% of the
then-remaining unpaid salary under the employment agreement, any bonus due him
and all outstanding stock options shall immediately become fully vested.

   BONUS PLAN

     Although there is no formal written plan, it is the Company's practice to
grant discretionary cash bonuses to the Company's employees on an annual basis.
The Compensation Committee has the discretion to award performance bonuses. The
Company awarded no bonuses to its employees in 2003.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT

     The Audit Committee's primary function is to assist the Board of Directors
in monitoring the integrity of the Company's financial statements, systems of
internal control and the audit process. The Committee is currently comprised of
three non-employee directors. The Board of Directors and the Committee believe
that the Committee's current member composition satisfies the rule of the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. that governs audit committee
composition, including the requirements that:

     - all audit committee members are "independent directors" as that term is
       defined by NASD Rule 4200(a)(15);

     - all audit committee members are able to read and understand fundamental
       financial statements; and

     - at least one audit committee member is financially sophisticated.

     The Committee operates under a written Charter adopted by the Board of
Directors that reflects standards contained in the NASD rules. The Audit
Committee reviews this Charter annually. A complete copy of the current Charter
was attached to the Proxy Statement for our 2002 annual meeting.

     The Committee has reviewed and discussed with management and the
independent auditors the Company's audited financial statements as of and for
the year ended December 31, 2003.

     In general, Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, Communication with
Audit Committees, as amended, issued by the Auditing Standards Board of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, requires the independent
auditors to provide the Committee with additional information regarding the
scope and results of the audit, including:

     - the independent auditor's responsibilities under general accepted
       auditing standards;

     - the independent auditor's judgments about the quality of the Company's
       accounting principles;

     - the adoption of, or a change in, accounting policies;

     - sensitive accounting estimates;

     - accounting for significant unusual transactions and for controversial or
       emerging areas;

     - significant audit adjustments;

     - unadjusted audit differences considered to be immaterial;

     - other information in documents containing audited financial statements;

     - total fees for management consulting services and types of services
       rendered;

     - disagreements with management on financial accounting and reporting
       matters;

     - major issues discussed with management prior to retention;

     - consultation with other accountants;

     - difficulties encountered in performing the audit; and

     - material errors, fraud and illegal acts.

     The Committee has discussed with the independent auditors the matters
required to be discussed by this Statement.

  <page>
   In general, Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1, Independence
Discussions with Audit Committees, as amended, requires the independent auditors
to communicate, at least annually, with the Committee regarding all
relationships between the independent auditors and the Company that, in the
professional judgment of the independent auditors, may reasonably be thought to
bear on their independence. The Committee has received and reviewed the written
disclosures and the letter from the independent auditors required by this
Standard, and the Committee has discussed with the independent auditors the
independent auditors' independence. When considering the auditors' independence,
the Committee considered whether their provision of services to the Company
beyond those rendered in connection with their audit and review of the Company's
consolidated financial statements was compatible with maintaining their
independence and discussed with the auditors any relationships that may impact
their objectivity and independence. The Committee also reviewed, among other
things, the amount of fees paid to the auditors for audit and non-audit services
in 2003. Information about the auditors' fees for 2003 is listed below in this
proxy statement under "Independent Auditors." Based on these discussions and
considerations, the Committee is satisfied as to the auditors' independence.

     Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Committee
recommends to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements
referred to above be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2003. We have also recommended to the Board of
Directors that McGladrey &amp; Pullen, LLP be selected as the Company's independent
auditors for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2004.

                              CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS


     On April 15, 2003, the Company retained Credit Support International, LLC
(CSI), whose Managing Member is Jim Mayer. Under the Consulting Agreement, Mr.
Mayer initially served as a consultant and then as Chief Restructuring Advisor
to the Company's Board of Directors to determine the Company's viability and
then to facilitate a restructuring of the Company's operations and financial
position. The Company and CSI entered into a Consulting Agreement in September
2003. Pursuant to the consulting agreement, the Company agreed to pay CSI a
monthly fee of $12,000, a monthly travel and housing allowance of $2,800, an
annual health care coverage allowance of $3,600, a bonus of $6,000 per month
upon the occurrence of certain events, and a fee upon the completion of certain
types of financing or other transactions. As part of the agreement, the Company
granted 144,000 options to acquire the Company's common stock to Mr. Mayer at an
exercise price of $0.67 per share. The options vest ratably over a one-year
period commencing in September 2003, and the options expire on April 15, 2008.
Pursuant to an amendment dated May 1, 2004, the Company hired Mr. Mayer as Chief
Financial and Administrative Officer and agreed to nominate Mr. Mayer to serve
as a Class II Director. Mr. Mayer's salary is currently $14,800 per month,
$17,334 per month beginning in September 2004, and $19,917 per month beginning
in September 2005. The agreement expires on August 31, 2006. In addition, the
Company agreed to fully vest and make immediately exercisable all 144,000
options previously granted to Mr. Mayer and agreed to grant options to purchase
288,000 shares of the Company's common stock on September 1, 2004.


2. INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

     The Board of Directors recommends that the stockholders ratify the
appointment of McGladrey &amp; Pullen, LLP by voting "FOR" ratification of McGladrey
&amp; Pullen, LLP as the Company's auditors for 2004. In the event such selection is
not ratified, the Board of Directors will reconsider its selection.

                                        11
  </page>
  <page>
   McGladrey &amp; Pullen, LLP has not previously audited the Company's financial
statements. Representatives of McGladrey &amp; Pullen, LLP are expected to be
present at the meeting with the opportunity to make a statement if they desire
to do so, and are expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions.

     McGladrey &amp; Pullen LLP replaces Grant Thornton, LLP, which has audited the
Company's financial statements since 1998. No representatives of Grant Thornton,
LLP are expected to attend the meeting. Grant Thornton was dismissed effective
April 15, 2004 with the approval of the Company Board of Directors. The Company
believes the change is in its best interests in terms of expense and scale of
services required by the Company's restructured operations. The reports of Grant
Thornton, LLP on the Company's financial statements for the fiscal years ended
December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 did not contain an adverse opinion or a
disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty,
audit scope or accounting principles, except that each such report did contain
an explanatory paragraph discussing the Company's ability to continue as a going
concern. During the Company's fiscal years ended December 31, 2003 and December
31, 2002, and the subsequent period through the date of its dismissal, there
were no disagreements between the Company and Grant Thornton, LLP as to any
matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or
auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements, if not resolved to the
satisfaction of Grant Thornton, LLP, would have caused it to make reference to
the subject matter of the dispute in connection with its reports.

   (a) All of these fees are for the audit of our financial statements for 2003,
    and for quarterly reviews.

(b) These fees are for auditing the benefit plan.

     All of the non-audit services disclosed above for 2003 were pre-approved by
the Audit Committee in accordance with the procedures described below. The Audit
Committee considered whether the non-audit consulting services provided by the
auditors' firm could impair the auditors' independence and concluded that such
services have not impaired the auditors' independence.

     All services to be provided by McGladrey &amp; Pullen, LLP are subject to
pre-approval by the Audit Committee. The Chairman of the Audit Committee
informally pre-approves audit and non-audit services, up to $5,000, with such
pre-approvals subsequently ratified by the full Audit Committee. Typically,
however, the Audit Committee itself reviews the matters to be approved. The
Audit Committee periodically monitors the services rendered by and actual fees
paid to the independent auditors to ensure that such services are within the
parameters approved by the Audit Committee. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act prohibits an
issuer from obtaining certain non-audit services from its auditing firm so as to
avoid certain potential conflicts of interest; the Company will not obtain any
of these prohibited services from McGladrey &amp; Pullen, LLP, and the Company is
able to obtain such services from other service providers at competitive rates.

     The Company paid no fees to McGladrey &amp; Pullen, LLP in 2002 or 2003.

3. AMENDMENT OF THE COMPANY'S CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO INCREASE THE
   NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED SHARES, AND TO REDUCE THE PAR VALUE, OF THE COMPANY'S
   COMMON STOCK

     On October 24, 2000, M-Wave's Board of Directors declared a two-for-one
split of the Company's common stock, which was completed through a stock
dividend paid on November 28, 2000 to shareholders of

                                        12
  </page>
  <page>
   record on November 13, 2000. Prior to the two-for-one split, the Company's
common stock had a par value of $.01 per share. Since the split, the Company's
balance sheet has recorded a par value of $.005 per share of common stock on its
balance sheet, as a result of the split. The Company now desires to amend its
certificate of incorporation to make the par value in the certificate of
incorporation consistent with the recorded par value of $.005 per share.

     In addition, the Company proposes to increase the number of authorized
shares of common stock from 10 million shares to 20 million shares of common
stock. There are no preemptive rights to purchase any such shares. As noted in
proposal 4 below, the Company proposes to issue 30,000 shares of preferred stock
and warrants to purchase 1,530,000 shares of common stock. Upon issuance, those
shares of preferred stock would be convertible into as many as 3,061,224 shares
of common stock. The Company currently has 6,180,037 shares of common stock
issued and outstanding, or reserved for issuance, and therefore could not
reserve all shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the preferred
stock and exercise of the warrants. The amendment to the Company's certificate
of incorporation would increase the authorized common stock in an amount
sufficient to allow the Company to reserve all shares issuable upon conversion
of such preferred stock and exercise of such warrants and provide for future
issuances from time to time in the judgment of the directors of the Company.
Although the approval of this proposal 3 is not a condition to the consummation
of the transaction described in proposal 4 below, the Company will need the
additional shares authorized by this proposal 3 to comply with its obligations
following consummation of the transaction described in proposal 4.

     A copy of the amendment to the Company's certificate of incorporation is
attached hereto as Appendix A. The Company's Board of Directors has adopted the
proposed amendment to the certificate of incorporation and recommends that the
stockholders approve such amendment. The affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the shares of the Company's common stock present (either in person
or by proxy) and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is required to approve
the amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation. Messrs. Turek and
Meyer, who own 36.8% of the outstanding shares of common stock, have indicated
that they intend to vote for this proposal.

4. APPROVAL OF SALE OF PREFERRED STOCK AND WARRANTS

     The Board of Directors of the Company has approved the issuance of 30,000
shares of the Company's newly designated Series A Preferred Stock to Mercator
Momentum Fund, LP, Mercator Momentum Fund III, LP, and Monarch Pointe, Ltd. (the
"Purchasers"), for $100 per share, or an aggregate of $3,000,000. The Company
will also issue warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,530,000 shares of common
stock, in consideration for the aggregate proceeds of $3,000,000, to the
Purchasers and Mercator Advisory Group, LLC, an affiliate of the Purchasers. The
Company will pay a due diligence fee of $160,000 and legal expenses of up to
$15,000 to Mercator Advisory Group, LLC.

     The Series A Preferred Stock is nonvoting, bears no dividend, has no
sinking fund provisions, and has a sole preference of priority at par in
liquidation over the Company's common stock and any prior or subsequent series
of preferred stock. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible into
shares of common stock at $100 per share of preferred stock and a conversion
price for the common stock equal to 85% of the market price of the Company's
common stock at the time of the conversion; provided that in no event shall the
conversion price be less than $0.98 per share or greater than the lesser of (a)
the closing price of the Company's common stock on June 17, 2004 (which closing
price was $1.15) or (b) the closing price on the closing date of the sale of the
preferred stock. The full rights of the Series A Preferred Stock are set forth
in the Certificate of Designations attached to this Proxy Statement as Appendix
B.

     The warrants will be allocated among the designated recipients by Mercator
Advisory Group, LLC, on the closing date of the sale of the Series A Preferred
Stock, and will be exercisable for three years at an exercise price of $1.27
(i.e., 110% of the market price of the Company's common stock on June 17, 2004).
A copy of the form of the warrants to be issued is attached to this Proxy
Statement as Appendix C.

     The Company has agreed to file a registration statement with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") registering the shares of common
stock issuable upon conversion of the preferred stock
                                        13
  </page>
  <page>
   and exercise of the warrants, and to use diligent efforts to have the
registration statement declared effective within 90 days (120 days if the SEC
reviews the filing) after the initial filing of the registration statement.
Under the terms of the agreements with the Purchasers, the ownership of the
Company's common stock by the Purchasers will not exceed 9.9% of the total
outstanding shares at any one time. In addition, the Purchasers agreed not to
sell, in any trading day, shares of the Company's common stock in excess of 15%
of the total shares traded on such trading day.

     Events of default under the preferred stock include (a) commencement of a
voluntary or involuntary case or proceeding in bankruptcy with respect to the
Company; (b) failure to file the registration statement specified above within
30 days after the closing of the offering; (c) failure to maintain the listing
of the Company's common stock on NASDAQ; or (d) failure to have the registration
statement deemed effective by the SEC within 90 days (120 days if the SEC
reviews the filing) after the initial filing. Upon the occurrence of an event of
default, the conversion price of the preferred stock shall be reduced from 85%,
as set forth above, to 75% of the applicable market price. In addition, if the
Company fails to file the registration statement within 30 days after closing of
the offering, the Company is required to pay an amount equal to 1% of the
purchase price (i.e., $30,000) of the preferred stock for each day that the
filing is late. The change in conversion price and the 1% payment per day that
the filing is late are the exclusive remedies for an event of default.

     The proceeds of the offering will be used by the Company for general
working capital purposes consistent with the Company's business strategy,
including potential acquisitions. In addition to raising money for general
working capital purposes, the Company is seeking to complete the sale of the
Series A Preferred Stock and issuance of the warrants in order to increase its
stockholders equity and maintain compliance with the "continued" listing
standards of the NASDAQ SmallCap Market. Such continued listing standards
include a requirement (NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(2)) that the Company
maintain either a market value of listed securities of $35 million, a
stockholders equity of $2.5 million or net income from continuing operations of
$500,000. The Company does not currently meet any of these requirements, and the
NASDAQ Staff has issued a Determination on May 14, 2004 that the Company's
common stock will be delisted unless the Company takes action to bring the
Company into compliance with the continued listing standards. On March 31, 2004,
the Company's stockholders equity was $839,252. The closing of the sale of the
preferred stock and warrants would increase the Company's stockholders equity by
the amount of the net proceeds of the offering, which are expected to be
approximately $2,625,000 (after estimated fees and expenses of $375,000). The
Company's receipt of such net proceeds from the offering would be expected to
bring the Company into compliance with this requirement of the continued listing
standards of the NASDAQ SmallCap Market.


     On June 18, 2004, representatives of the Company presented to a NASDAQ
Listing Qualifications Panel its plan for future compliance with the
stockholders equity requirements under Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(2). The plan is
founded upon the completion of the proposed sale of Series A Preferred Stock and
issuance of the warrants, and projections for operating results that do not
erode the stockholders equity after receipt of the proceeds of such sale and
issuance. The Company expects a decision by the Panel within two to three weeks
after the hearing, and therefore prior to the Special Meeting, and the Company
has no assurances of the decision. The Board of Directors believes that it is in
the Company's best interests to remain listed on the NASDAQ SmallCap Market and
that the consummations of the sale of Series A Preferred Stock and issuance of
the warrants is essential to maintaining such listing. However, the Company may
not be able to prevent an delisting of the Company's comment stock, even if such
transaction is consummated. If the Company's common stock is delisted, the
Company would need to meet the NASDAQ SmallCap Market's higher "initial" listing
standards to list the Company's common stock again. In particular, the
stockholders equity requirement is $5 million under the initial listing
standards, as opposed to $2.5 million under the continued listing standards.


     Stockholder approval of the sale of the preferred stock and issuance of the
warrants is required by NASDAQ Marketplace Rules, and the affirmative vote of a
majority of the total votes cast on the proposal is required to obtain such
stockholder approval. Messrs. Turek and Meyer, who own 36.8% of the outstanding
shares of common stock, have indicated that they intend to vote for this
proposal.

                                        14
  </page>
  <page>
   If stockholder approval is obtained or if the Company is delisted from the
NASDAQ SmallCap Market (thereby eliminating the requirement for stockholder
approval), the proposed sale of Series A Preferred Stock and issuance of
warrants will be consummated. If the Company maintains its listing on the NASDAQ
SmallCap Market but stockholder approval is not obtained, the Company's Board of
Directors will make a determination of whether to consummate the transaction and
the Purchasers will have the option to terminate the proposed transaction.

5. OTHER MATTERS

     The Board of Directors of the Company is not aware that any matter other
than those listed in the Notice of Meeting is to be presented for action at the
Special Meeting. If any of the Board's nominees is unavailable for election as a
Director or any other matter should properly come before the meeting, it is
intended that votes will be cast pursuant to the proxy card in respect thereto
in accordance with the best judgment of the person or persons acting as proxies.

                      SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK

                             A DELAWARE CORPORATION

     The undersigned, Joseph A. Turek and Jim Mayer, certify that:

     1. They are the duly acting President and Secretary, respectively, of
M-WAVE, INC., a corporation organized and existing under the Corporation Code of
the State of Delaware (the "Corporation").

     2. Pursuant to authority conferred upon the Board of Directors by the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, and pursuant to the provisions
of the Corporations Code of the State of Delaware said Board of Directors,
pursuant to a meeting held June 11, 2004, adopted a resolution establishing the
rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of, and the number of shares
comprising, the Corporation's Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, which
resolution is as follows:

     RESOLVED, that a series of Preferred Stock in M-Wave, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Corporation"), having the rights, preferences, privileges and
restrictions, and the number of shares constituting such series and the
designation of such series, set forth below be, and it hereby is, authorized by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation pursuant to authority given by the
Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation.

     NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Directors hereby fixes
and determines the Designations of, the number of shares constituting, and the
rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions relating to, a new series of
Preferred Stock as follows:

          (a) Determination.  The series of Preferred Stock is hereby designated
     Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the "SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK").

          (b) Authorized Shares.  The number of authorized shares constituting
     the Series A Preferred Stock shall be thirty thousand (30,000) shares of
     such series.

          (c) Dividends.  The holder of the Series A Preferred Stock shall only
     be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors,
     out of any assets of the Corporation legally available therefor, such
     dividends as may be declared from time to time by the Board of Directors.

          (d) Liquidation Preference.

             (i) Preference upon Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up.  In the
        event of any dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether
        voluntary or involuntary, holders of each outstanding share of Series A
        Preferred Stock shall be entitled to be paid first out of the assets of
        the Corporation available for distribution to shareholders, whether such
        assets are capital, surplus or earnings, an amount equal to $100.00 (the
        "SERIES A PURCHASE PRICE") per share of Series A Preferred Stock held
        (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends or recapitalizations
        of the Series A Preferred Stock) and any declared but unpaid dividends
        on such share, before any payment shall be made to the holders of the
        Common Stock, or any other stock of the Corporation ranking junior to
        the Series A Preferred Stock with regard to any distribution of assets
        upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. The
        holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to share
        ratably, in accordance with the respective preferential amounts payable
        on such stock, in any distribution which is not sufficient to pay in
        full the aggregate of the amounts payable thereon. If, upon any
        liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the assets to
        be distributed to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be
        insufficient to permit payment to such shareholders of the full
        preferential amounts aforesaid, then all of the assets of the
        Corporation available for

                                       B-1
  </page>
  <page>
   distribution to shareholders shall be distributed to the holders of
        Series A Preferred Stock. Each holder of the Series A Preferred Stock
        shall be entitled to receive that portion of the assets available for
        distribution as the number of outstanding shares of Series A Preferred
        Stock held by such holder bears to the total number of shares of Series
        A Preferred Stock. Such payment shall constitute payment in full to the
        holders of the Series A Preferred Stock upon the liquidation,
        dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. After such payment shall
        have been made in full, or funds necessary for such payment shall have
        been set aside by the Corporation in trust for the account of the
        holders of Series A Preferred Stock, so as to be available for such
        payment, such holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
        no further participation in the distribution of the assets of the
        Corporation.

             (ii) Consolidation, Merger and Other Corporate Events.  A
        consolidation or merger of the Corporation (except into or with a
        subsidiary corporation) or a sale, lease, mortgage, pledge, exchange,
        transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets
        of the Corporation or any reclassification of the stock of the
        Corporation (other than a change in par value or from no par to par, or
        from par to no par or as the result of an event described in subsection
        (iv), (v), (vi) or (viii) of paragraph (f)), shall be regarded as a
        liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation
        within the meaning of this paragraph (d); provided however, in the case
        of a merger, if (a) the Company is the surviving entity, (b) the
        Company's shareholders hold a majority of the shares of the surviving
        entity, and (c) the Company's directors hold a majority of the seats on
        the board of directors of the surviving entity, then such merger shall
        not be regarded as a liquidation, dissolution or winding up within the
        meaning of this paragraph (d). In no event shall the issuance of new
        classes of stock, whether senior, junior or on a parity with the Series
        A Preferred Stock, or any stock splits, be deemed a "reclassification"
        under or otherwise limited by the terms hereof.

             (iii) Distribution of Cash and Other Assets.  In the event of a
        liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation resulting in
        the availability of assets other than cash for distribution to the
        holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, the holders of the Series A
        Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a distribution of cash and/or
        assets equal to the value of the liquidation preference stated in
        subsection (i) of this paragraph (d), which valuation shall be made
        solely by the Board of Directors, and provided that such Board of
        Directors was acting in good faith, shall be conclusive.

             (iv) Distribution to Junior Security Holders.  After the payment or
        distribution to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock of the full
        preferential amounts aforesaid, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock
        shall have no further rights in respect of such Series A Stock which
        shall become null and void, and the holders of the Common Stock then
        outstanding, or any other stock of the Corporation ranking as to assets
        upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation junior to
        the Series A Preferred Stock, shall be entitled to receive ratably all
        of the remaining assets of the Corporation.

             (v) Preference; Priority.  References to a stock that is "SENIOR"
        to, on a "PARITY" with or "JUNIOR" to other stock as to liquidation
        shall refer, respectively, to rights of priority of one series or class
        of stock over another in the distribution of assets on any liquidation,
        dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. The Series A Preferred
        Stock shall be senior to the Common Stock of the Corporation and senior
        to any subsequent series of Preferred Stock issued by the Corporation.

          (e) Voting Rights.  Except as otherwise required by law, the holder of
     shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not have the right to vote on
     matters that come before the shareholders.

          (f) Conversion Rights.  The holders of Series A Preferred Stock will
     have the following conversion rights:

             (i) Right to Convert.  Subject to and in compliance with the
        provisions of this paragraph (f), any issued and outstanding shares of
        Series A Preferred Stock may, at the option of the holder, be converted
        at any time or from time to time into fully paid and non-assessable
        shares of Common Stock at the conversion rate in effect at the time of
        conversion, determined as provided herein;

                                       B-2
  </page>
  <page>
   provided, that a holder of Series A Preferred Stock may at any given
        time convert only up to that number of shares of Series A Preferred
        Stock so that, upon conversion, the aggregate beneficial ownership of
        the Corporation's Common Stock (calculated pursuant to Rule 13d-3 of the
        Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of such holder and all
        persons affiliated with such holder is not more than 9.99% of the
        Corporation's Common Stock then outstanding.

             (ii) Mechanics of Conversion.  Before any holder of Series A
        Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into shares of
        Common Stock, he shall surrender the certificate or certificates
        therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any
        transfer agent for the Common Stock, and shall give written notice to
        the Corporation at such office that he elects to convert the same and
        shall state therein the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock
        being converted. Thereupon, the Corporation shall promptly issue and
        deliver at such office to such holder of Series A Preferred Stock a
        certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to
        which he shall be entitled. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been
        made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such
        surrender of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be converted, and
        the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock
        issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the
        record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date.

             (iii) Conversion Price.  The number of shares into which one share
        of Series A Preferred Stock shall be convertible shall be determined by
        dividing $100.00 (the "Series A Purchase Price") by the then existing
        Conversion Price (as set forth below) (the "Conversion Ratio"). The
        "Conversion Price" per share for the Series A Preferred Stock shall be
        equal to eighty-five percent (85%) of the Market Price (as defined below
        and subject to adjustment as described below), rounded to the nearest
        penny; provided, however, that subject to the provisions of the next
        sentence, in no event shall the Conversion Price be less than $0.98 per
        share (the "FLOOR PRICE") or exceed the lesser of the closing price of
        the Corporation's Common Stock on (a) June 4, 2004, (b) June 17, 2004,
        or (c) the Closing Date (as that term is defined in the Subscription
        Agreement of even date herewith) per share (the "Ceiling Price"). The
        Floor Price and Ceiling Price shall be further adjusted upon the
        occurrence of any event in paragraph (f)(iv).

             For purposes of determining the Conversion Price, the "MARKET
        PRICE" shall be the average of the lowest three inter-day trading prices
        of the Corporation's Common Stock (which need not occur on consecutive
        trading days) during the 10 trading days immediately preceding the
        conversion date (which may include trading days prior to the original
        issue date), provided, that such 10 trading day period shall be extended
        by the number of trading days during such period on which (i) trading in
        the Corporation's Common Stock is suspended by, or not traded on, the
        OTC Bulletin Board or a subsequent market on which the common stock is
        then traded, or (ii) after the date of Registration Statement (the
        "Registration Statement") for the underlying shares of common stock of
        the Corporation into which the Series A Preferred Stock may be converted
        is declared effective by the SEC, the prospectus included in the
        Registration Statement may not be used by the holder for resale of
        underlying shares of common stock, is suspended by, or not traded on,
        the OTC Bulletin Board or a subsequent market on which the common stock
        is then listed, or (iii) after the date the Registration Statement is
        declared effective by the SEC, the prospectus included in the
        Registration Statement for the underlying shares may not be used by the
        holder for the resale of underlying shares of common stock (provided
        such inability to use the prospectus is not (a) caused by the holder or
        (b) as a result of the Company's filing of post-effective amendments to
        the Registration Statement.)

             For purposes of illustration only, assuming the Ceiling Price is
        $1.60 per share, if the Market Price is $1.50 at time of conversion, the
        Conversion Ratio will be $100.00/$1.28, allowing the 30,000 shares of
        Series A Preferred Stock to be converted into 2,343,750 shares of Common
        Stock. On the other hand, if the Market Price is $1.00 at time of
        conversion, the Conversion Ratio will be $100.00/$0.98, allowing the
        30,000 shares of Preferred Stock to be converted into 3,061,224 shares
        of Common Stock.

   If an Event of Default occurs, as defined in the Subscription
        Agreement for the Series A Preferred Stock, the Conversion Price shall
        be reduced to seventy percent (75%) of the Market Price, provided,
        however, in no event shall the Conversion Price be less than the Floor
        Price.

             (iv) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations.  If the
        Corporation shall at any time, or from time to time after the date
        shares of the Series A Preferred Stock are first issued (the "ORIGINAL
        ISSUE DATE"), effect a subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock, the
        Floor Price and Ceiling Price in effect immediately prior thereto shall
        be proportionately decreased, and conversely, if the Corporation shall
        at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date combine
        the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Floor Price and Ceiling
        Price then in effect immediately before the combination shall be
        proportionately increased. Any adjustment under this paragraph (f)(iv)
        shall become effective at the close of business on the date the
        subdivision or combination becomes effective.

             (v) Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions.  In the
        event the Corporation at any time, or from time to time after the
        Original Issue Date, shall make or issue, or fix a record date for the
        determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend
        or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock, then
        and in each such event the Floor Price and Ceiling Price then in effect
        shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in the event such
        a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such
        record date, by multiplying the Floor Price and Ceiling Price then in
        effect by a fraction:

                (A) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares
           of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time
           of such issuance or the close of business on such record date, and

                (B) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares
           of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time
           of such issuance or the close of business on such record date plus
           the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such
           dividend or distribution; provided, however, if such record date
           shall have been fixed and such dividend is not fully paid or if such
           distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Floor
           Price and Ceiling Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the
           close of business on such record date and thereafter, the Floor Price
           and Ceiling Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this paragraph (f)(v)
           as of the time of actual payment of such dividends or distributions.

             (vi) Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions.  In the
        event the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the
        Original Issue Date shall make or issue, or fix a record date for the
        determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend
        or other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation other
        than shares of Common Stock, then and in each such event provision shall
        be made so that the holders of such Series A Preferred Stock shall
        receive upon conversion thereof in addition to the number of shares of
        Common Stock receivable thereupon, the amount of securities of the
        Corporation that they would have received had their Series A Preferred
        Stock been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event and had
        thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and
        including the conversion date, retained such securities receivable by
        them as aforesaid during such period giving application to all
        adjustments called for during such period under this paragraph (f) with
        respect to the rights of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock.

             (vii) Adjustment for Reclassification Exchange or Substitution.  If
        the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred
        Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of
        any class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization,
        reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination
        of shares or stock dividend provided for above, or a reorganization,
        merger, consolidation or sale of assets provided for elsewhere in this
        paragraph (f)), then and in each such event the holder of each share of
        Series A Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such
        share into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities
        and property receivable upon such reorganization, reclassification or
        other
                                       B-4
  </page>
  <page>
   change, by holders of the number of shares of Common Stock into which
        such shares of Series A Preferred Stock might have been converted
        immediately prior to such reorganization, reclassification, or change,
        all subject to further adjustment as provided herein.

             (viii) Reorganization, Mergers, Consolidations or Sales of
        Assets.  If at any time or from time to time there shall be a capital
        reorganization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision,
        combination, reclassification or exchange of shares provided for
        elsewhere in this paragraph (f)) or a merger or consolidation of the
        Corporation with or into another corporation, or the sale of all or
        substantially all of the Corporation's properties and assets to any
        other person, then, as a part of such reorganization, merger,
        consolidation or sale, provision shall be made so that the holders of
        the Series A Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive
        upon conversion of such Series A Preferred Stock, the number of shares
        of stock or other securities or property of the Corporation or of the
        successor corporation resulting from such merger or consolidation or
        sale, to which a holder of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion
        would have been entitled on such capital reorganization, merger,
        consolidation or sale. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be
        made in the application of the provisions of this paragraph (f) with
        respect to the rights of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock
        after the reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale to the end that
        the provisions of this paragraph (f) (including adjustment of the Floor
        Price and Ceiling Price then in effect and the number of shares
        purchasable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock) shall be
        applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as may be practicable.

             (ix) Certificate of Adjustment.  In each case of an adjustment or
        readjustment of the Floor Price and Ceiling Price or the securities
        issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, the
        Corporation shall compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance
        herewith and the Corporation's Chief Financial Officer shall prepare and
        sign a certificate showing such adjustment or readjustment, and shall
        mail such certificate by first class mail, postage prepaid, to each
        registered holder of the Series A Preferred Stock at the holder's
        address as shown in the Corporation's books. The certificate shall set
        forth such adjustment or readjustment, showing in detail the facts upon
        which such adjustment or readjustment is based.

             (x) Notices of Record Date.  In the event of (A) any taking by the
        Corporation of a record of the holders of any class or series of
        securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof who are
        entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution or (B) any
        reclassification or recapitalization of the capital stock of the
        Corporation, any merger or consolidation of the Corporation or any
        transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation to
        any other corporation, entity or person, or any voluntary or involuntary
        dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation, the
        Corporation shall mail to each holder of Series A Preferred Stock at
        least 10 days prior to the record date specified therein, a notice
        specifying (1) the date on which any such record is to be taken for the
        purpose of such dividend or distribution and a description of such
        dividend or distribution, (2) the date on which any such reorganization,
        reclassification, transfer, consolidation, merger, dissolution,
        liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective and (3) the
        time, if any is to be fixed, as to when the holders of record of Common
        Stock (or other securities) shall be entitled to exchange their shares,
        of Common Stock (or other securities) for securities or other property
        deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, transfer,
        consolidation, merger, dissolution, liquidation or winding up.

             (xi) Fractional Shares.  No fractional shares of Common Stock shall
        be issued upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock. In lieu of
        any fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled,
        the Corporation shall pay cash equal to the product of such fraction
        multiplied by the fair market value of one share of the Corporation's
        Common Stock on the date of conversion, as determined in good faith by
        the Board of Directors.

             (xii) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion.  The
        Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its
        authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose
        of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Series A Preferred
        Stock, three million sixty-

                                       B-5
  </page>
  <page>
   one thousand two hundred twenty-four (3,061,224) shares of Common Stock,
        and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of
        Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all
        then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, the Corporation
        will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel,
        be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common
        Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

             (xiii) Notices.  Any notice required by the provisions of this
        paragraph (f) to be given to the holders of shares of Series A Preferred
        Stock shall be deemed given (A) if deposited in the United States mail,
        postage prepaid, or (B) if given by any other reliable or generally
        accepted means (including by facsimile or by a nationally recognized
        overnight courier service), in each case addressed to each holder of
        record at his address (or facsimile number) appearing on the books of
        the Corporation.

             (xiv) Payment of Taxes.  The Corporation will pay all transfer
        taxes and other governmental charges that may be imposed in respect of
        the issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of
        shares of Series A Preferred Stock.

             (xv) No Dilution or Impairment.  The Corporation shall not amend
        its Articles of Incorporation or participate in any reorganization,
        transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of
        securities or any other voluntary action, for the purpose of avoiding or
        seeking to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be
        observed or performed hereunder by the Corporation, without the approval
        of a majority of the then outstanding Series A Preferred Stock.

          (g) No Reissuance of Preferred Stock.  Any shares of Series A
     Preferred Stock acquired by the Corporation by reason of purchase,
     conversion or otherwise shall be canceled, retired and eliminated from the
     shares of Series A Preferred Stock that the Corporation shall be authorized
     to issue. All such shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized
     but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a new
     series of Preferred Stock subject to the conditions and restrictions on
     issuance set forth in the Articles of Incorporation or in any certificate
     of Designations creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock
     or as otherwise required by law.

          (h) Non-transferable.  The Series A Preferred Stock is
     non-transferable except by operation of law.

          (i) Severability.  If any right, preference or limitation of the
     Series A Preferred Stock set forth herein is invalid, unlawful or incapable
     of being enforced by reason of any rule, law or public policy, all other
     rights, preferences and limitations set forth herein that can be given
     effect without the invalid, unlawful or unenforceable right, preference or
     limitation shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect, and no
     right, preference or limitation herein shall be deemed dependent upon any
     other such right, preference or limitation unless so expressed herein.

     3. The number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock of the Corporation is
1,000,000, and the number of shares of Series A Stock, none of which has been
issued, is 30,000.

     THIS WARRANT AND THE SECURITIES ISSUABLE HEREUNDER HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR ANY STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THEY

   THIS WARRANT CERTIFIES THAT for value received,           or its registered
assigns (hereinafter called the "HOLDER") is entitled to purchase from M-Wave,
Inc. (hereinafter called the "COMPANY"), the above referenced number of fully
paid and nonassessable shares (the "SHARES") of common stock (the "COMMON
STOCK"), of Company, at the Warrant Price per Share referenced above; the number
of shares purchasable upon exercise of this Warrant referenced above being
subject to adjustment from time to time as described herein. This Warrant is
issued in connection with that certain Subscription Agreement dated as of June
  , 2004, by and between the Company and Holder (the "SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT").
The exercise of this Warrant shall be subject to the provisions, limitations and
restrictions contained herein.

1.  TERM AND EXERCISE.

     1.1  Term.  This Warrant is exercisable in whole or in part (but not as to
any fractional share of Common Stock), at any time and from time to time after
the date hereof prior to 6:00 p.m. on the Expiration Date set forth above.

     1.2  Warrant Price.  The Warrant shall be exercisable at the Warrant Price
described above.

     1.3  Maximum Number of Shares.  The maximum number of Shares of Common
Stock exercisable pursuant to this Warrant is           Shares. However,
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall the Holder be
permitted to exercise this Warrant for a number of Shares greater than the
number that would cause the aggregate beneficial ownership of the Company's
Common Stock (calculated pursuant to Rule 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended) of the Holder and all persons affiliated with the Holder to
equal 9.99% of the Company's Common Stock then outstanding.

     1.4  Procedure for Exercise of Warrant.  Holder may exercise this Warrant
by delivering the following to the principal office of the Company in accordance
with Section 5.1 hereof: (i) a duly executed Notice of Exercise in substantially
the form attached as Schedule A, (ii) payment of the Warrant Price then in
effect for each of the Shares being purchased, as designated in the Notice of
Exercise, and (iii) this Warrant. Payment of the Warrant Price may be in cash,
certified or official bank check payable to the order of the Company, or wire
transfer of funds to the Company's account (or any combination of any of the
foregoing) in the amount of the Warrant Price for each share being purchased.

     1.5  Delivery of Certificate and New Warrant.  In the event of any exercise
of the rights represented by this Warrant, a certificate or certificates for the
shares of Common Stock so purchased, registered in the name of the Holder or
such other name or names as may be designated by the Holder, together with any
other

                                       C-1
  </page>
  <page>
   securities or other property which the Holder is entitled to receive upon
exercise of this Warrant, shall be delivered to the Holder hereof, at the
Company's expense, within a reasonable time, not exceeding fifteen (15) calendar
days, after the rights represented by this Warrant shall have been so exercised;
and, unless this Warrant has expired, a new Warrant representing the number of
Shares (except a remaining fractional share), if any, with respect to which this
Warrant shall not then have been exercised shall also be issued to the Holder
hereof within such time. The person in whose name any certificate for shares of
Common Stock is issued upon exercise of this Warrant shall for all purposes be
deemed to have become the holder of record of such shares on the date on which
the Warrant was surrendered and payment of the Warrant Price was received by the
Company, irrespective of the date of delivery of such certificate, except that,
if the date of such surrender and payment is on a date when the stock transfer
books of the Company are closed, such person shall be deemed to have become the
holder of such Shares at the close of business on the next succeeding date on
which the stock transfer books are open.

     1.6  Restrictive Legend.  Each certificate for Shares shall bear a
restrictive legend in substantially the form as follows, together with any
additional legend required by (i) any applicable state securities laws and (ii)
any securities exchange upon which such Shares may, at the time of such
exercise, be listed:

          "The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered
     under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and may not be sold, offered
     for sale, transferred or pledged in the absence of such registration or an
     exemption therefrom under such Act."

     Any certificate issued at any time in exchange or substitution for any
certificate bearing such legend shall also bear such legend unless, in the
opinion of counsel for the Holder thereof (which counsel shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Company), the securities represented thereby are not, at
such time, required by law to bear such legend.

     1.7  Fractional Shares.  No fractional Shares shall be issuable upon
exercise or conversion of the Warrant and the number of Shares to be issued
shall be rounded down to the nearest whole Share. If a fractional share interest
arises upon any exercise or conversion of the Warrant, the Company shall
eliminate such fractional share interest by paying to Holder an amount computed
by multiplying the fractional interest by the Current Market Price (as defined
below) of a full Share. For purposes of this Warrant, the "CURRENT MARKET PRICE"
of one share of Common Stock as of a particular date shall be determined as
follows: (i) if traded on a national securities exchange or through the Nasdaq
Stock Market, the Current Market Price shall be deemed to be the volume weighted
average trading price of the Common Stock on such exchange as of five business
days immediately prior to such date (or if no reported sales took place on such
day, the last date on which any such sales took place prior to the date of
exercise); (ii) if traded over-the-counter but not on the Nasdaq Stock Market,
the Current Market Price shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid
and asked prices as of five business days immediately prior to such date; and
(iii) if there is no active public market, the Current Market Price shall be the

2.  REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS.

     2.1  Representations and Warranties.

          (a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and
     in good standing under the laws of its state of incorporation and has all
     necessary power and authority to perform its obligations under this
     Warrant;

          (b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Warrant has been
     duly authorized by all necessary actions on the part of the Company and
     constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company,
     enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms; and

          (c) This Warrant does not violate and is not in conflict with any of
     the provisions of the Company's Amended and Restated Articles of
     Incorporation or Certificate of Determination, Bylaws and any resolutions
     of the Company's Board of Directors or stockholders, or any agreement of
     the Company, and

                                       C-2
  </page>
  <page>
   no event has occurred and no condition or circumstance exists that might
     (with or without notice or lapse of time) constitute or result directly or
     indirectly in such a violation or conflict.

     2.2  Issuance of Shares.  The Company covenants and agrees that all shares
of Common Stock that may be issued upon the exercise of the rights represented
by this Warrant will, upon issuance, be validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the
issue thereof. The Company further covenants and agrees that it will pay when
due and payable any and all federal and state taxes which may be payable in
respect of the issue of this Warrant or any Common Stock or certificates
therefor issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant. The Company further
covenants and agrees that the Company will at all times have authorized and
reserved, free from preemptive rights, a sufficient number of shares of Common
Stock to provide for the exercise in full of the rights represented by this
Warrant. If at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common
Stock of the Company shall not be sufficient to effect the exercise of the
Warrant in full, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 1.3 hereto,
then the Company will take all such corporate action as may, in the opinion of
counsel to the Company, be necessary or advisable to increase the number of its
authorized shares of Common Stock as shall be sufficient to permit the exercise
of the Warrant in full, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 1.3
hereto, including without limitation, using its best efforts to obtain any
necessary stockholder approval of such increase. The Company further covenants
and agrees that if any shares of capital stock to be reserved for the purpose of
the issuance of shares upon the exercise of this Warrant require registration
with or approval of any governmental authority under any federal or state law
before such shares may be validly issued or delivered upon exercise, then the
Company will in good faith and as expeditiously as possible endeavor to secure
such registration or approval, as the case may be. If and so long as the Common
Stock issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant is listed on any national
securities exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market, the Company will, if permitted
by the rules of such exchange or market, list and keep listed on such exchange
or market, upon official notice of issuance, all shares of such Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of this Warrant.

3.  OTHER ADJUSTMENTS.

     3.1  Subdivision or Combination of Shares.  In case the Company shall at
any time subdivide its outstanding Common Stock into a greater number of shares,
the Warrant Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall be
proportionately reduced, and the number of Shares subject to this Warrant shall
be proportionately increased, and conversely, in case the outstanding Common
Stock of the Company shall be combined into a smaller number of shares, the
Warrant Price in effect immediately prior to such combination shall be
proportionately increased, and the number of Shares subject to this Warrant
shall be proportionately decreased.

     3.2  Dividends in Common Stock, Other Stock or Property.  If at any time or
from time to time the holders of Common Stock (or any shares of stock or other
securities at the time receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant) shall have
received or become entitled to receive, without payment therefor:

          (a) Common Stock, Options or any shares or other securities which are
     at any time directly or indirectly convertible into or exchangeable for
     Common Stock, or any rights or options to subscribe for, purchase or
     otherwise acquire any of the foregoing by way of dividend or other
     distribution;

          (b) any cash paid or payable otherwise than as a regular cash
     dividend; or

          (c) Common Stock or additional shares or other securities or property
     (including cash) by way of spin-off, split-up, reclassification,
     combination of shares or similar corporate rearrangement (other than Common
     Stock issued as a stock split or adjustments in respect of which shall be
     covered by the terms of Section 3.1 above) or additional shares, other
     securities or property issued in connection with a Change (as defined
     below) (which shall be covered by the terms of Section 3.4 below), then and
     in each such case, the Holder hereof shall, upon the exercise of this
     Warrant, be entitled to receive, in addition to the number of shares of
     Common Stock receivable thereupon, and without payment of any additional
     consideration therefor, the amount of stock and other securities and
     property (including cash in the cases referred to in clause (b) above and
     this clause (c)) which such Holder would hold on the date of such exercise
     had such Holder been the holder of record of such Common Stock as of the
     date on which
                                       C-3
  </page>
  <page>
   holders of Common Stock received or became entitled to receive such shares
     or all other additional stock and other securities and property.

     3.3  Reorganization, Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger or Sale.  If
any recapitalization, reclassification or reorganization of the share capital of
the Company, or any consolidation or merger of the Company with another
corporation, or the sale of all or substantially all of its shares and/or assets
or other transaction (including, without limitation, a sale of substantially all
of its assets followed by a liquidation) shall be effected in such a way that
holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive shares, securities or other
assets or property (a "Change"), then, as a condition of such Change, lawful and
adequate provisions shall be made by the Company whereby the Holder hereof shall
thereafter have the right to purchase and receive (in lieu of the Common Stock
of the Company immediately theretofore purchasable and receivable upon the
exercise of the rights represented hereby) such shares, securities or other
assets or property as may be issued or payable with respect to or in exchange
for the number of outstanding Common Stock which such Holder would have been
entitled to receive had such Holder exercised this Warrant immediately prior to
the consummation of such Change. The Company or its successor shall promptly
issue to Holder a new Warrant for such new securities or other property. The new
Warrant shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may
be practicable to give effect to the adjustments provided for in this Section 3
including, without limitation, adjustments to the Warrant Price and to the
number of securities or property issuable upon exercise of the new Warrant. The
provisions of this Section 3.3 shall similarly apply to successive Changes.

4.  OWNERSHIP AND TRANSFER.

     4.1  Ownership of This Warrant.  The Company may deem and treat the person
in whose name this Warrant is registered as the holder and owner hereof
(notwithstanding any notations of ownership or writing hereon made by anyone
other than the Company) for all purposes and shall not be affected by any notice
to the contrary until presentation of this Warrant for registration of transfer
as provided in this Section 4.

     4.2  Non-transferability and Replacement.  This Warrant and all rights
hereunder are not transferable except by operation of law. Upon receipt by the
Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft or
destruction, and, in such case, of indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory
to it, and upon surrender of this Warrant if mutilated, the Company will make
and deliver a new Warrant of like tenor, in lieu of this Warrant; provided that
if the Holder hereof is an instrumentality of a state or local government or an
institutional holder or a nominee for such an instrumentality or institutional
holder an irrevocable agreement of indemnity by such Holder shall be sufficient
for all purposes of this Warrant, and no evidence of loss or theft or
destruction shall be necessary. This Warrant shall be promptly cancelled by the
Company upon the surrender hereof in connection with any transfer or
replacement. In the case of the loss, theft or destruction of a Warrant, the
Holder shall pay all expenses, taxes and other charges payable in connection
with any replacement of this Warrant.

not entitle the Holder to any of the rights of a shareholder of the Company
except upon exercise in accordance with the terms hereof. No provision hereof,

or as a shareholder of the Company, whether such liability is asserted by the
Company or by creditors of the Company.

     5.4  Governing Law.  This Warrant shall be governed by and construed in

successors and assigns of the Holder.

hereof may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated only by an instrument in
writing signed by both parties (either generally or in a particular instance and
either retroactively or prospectively). The headings in this Warrant are for
purposes of reference only and shall not affect the meaning or construction of
any of the provisions hereof.

suits or proceedings based on or arising under this Agreement may be brought
only in and shall be resolved in the federal or state courts located in the City
of Los Angeles, California and consents to the jurisdiction of such courts for

inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such suit or proceeding in any such
court. Each of the parties further agrees that service of process upon such
party mailed by first class mail to the address set forth in Section 5.1 shall
be deemed in every respect effective service of process upon such party in any
such suit or proceeding. Nothing herein shall affect the right of a Holder to
serve process in any other manner permitted by law. Each of the parties agrees
that a final non-appealable judgment in any such suit or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on such judgment
or in any other lawful manner.

     5.8  Attorneys' Fees and Disbursements.  If any action at law or in equity
is necessary to enforce or interpret the terms of this Agreement, the prevailing
party or parties shall be entitled to receive from the other party or parties
